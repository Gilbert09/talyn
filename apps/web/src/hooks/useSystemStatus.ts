/**
 * Preloads integration connection state into the workspace store at startup
 * (mount once from MainLayout) so anything that reads it — the global
 * SystemStatusBanner and Settings → Integrations — renders instantly instead
 * of fetching on open.
 *
 * GitHub reuses useGithubConnection's fetch + on-focus re-check, which also
 * catches OAuth completing in the external browser, so reconnecting clears the
 * banner without a manual refresh. PostHog Code credentials only change from
 * inside the app (the Settings card writes the new status straight to the
 * store) OR via the OAuth flow, which leaves the app entirely — so it is
 * re-checked on focus too.
 *
 * Cloud-provider connection status is loaded here too (not per-component) so
 * the Settings cards, the default-provider selector, the sidebar status row,
 * and the per-task picker all read one store value — and it's re-checked on
 * window focus, on the env WS events, and after a reconnect, so connecting a
 * provider then leaving + returning to the tab never shows a stale state.
 *
 * Allow-listed feature flags (`GET /features`) are loaded here too — account
 * level, so a workspace switch does not re-fetch them, but re-checked on focus
 * and after a reconnect, because a flag flips in the backend's environment and
 * the app has no in-process signal that it did. `null` means still loading and
 * absent means not offered; anything reading them must treat those the same way
 * `cloudProviderOffered` does, or the gated nav item flashes in on every load.
