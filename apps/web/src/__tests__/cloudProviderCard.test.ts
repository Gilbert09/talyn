 * Whether a provider card renders at all.
 *
 * This file used to also cover a generic, descriptor-driven `CloudProviderCard`
 * and its two form helpers. That card is gone: both remaining cards (PostHog
 * Code, Talyn Fleet) are bespoke, because each has more than one way to connect
 * and one field list behind one Connect/Disconnect pair cannot express that.
 *
 * What survives is the rule that outlived it — and it is the one that actually
 * caused a visible bug.
