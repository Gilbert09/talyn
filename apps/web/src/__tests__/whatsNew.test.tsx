/**
 * The "What's new" modal and the launch-time check that decides whether to
 * open it.
 *
 * The interesting cases are all about NOT showing it: a first run, a nightly
 * with nothing user-facing, a release whose highlights were all for the other
 * client, and a second mount. Getting any of those wrong means a modal in
 * front of a user who has nothing to read.
 *
 * The one thing this app does NOT do is cap by version. app.talyn.dev is
 * continuously deployed, so it is always at or ahead of the newest cut release
 * — the desktop's "don't show me a release I haven't installed" ceiling has
 * nothing to protect against here, and its build id (`web/<sha>`) has no order
 * to compare with anyway.
 *
 * Duplicated in the other app on purpose: the renderer is a deliberate fork.
