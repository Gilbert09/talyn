/**
 * Helpers shared by every surface that reasons about GitHub App *installation
 * coverage* — onboarding, Settings, and the global banner. A repo is only
 * tracked by Talyn if its owner org/account has an active (non-suspended)
 * App installation, so these turn the raw installation list into the
 * owner-level checks the UI needs, and start the install flow in the browser.
 */

/**
 * Start the GitHub App flow. `connect` runs OAuth authorize (first
 * connection); `manage` opens the installations page to add the App to
 * another org or change which repos it can access.
 *
 * Runs in a SEPARATE tab, because callers depend on this page staying alive.
 * ConnectGitHubStep is the reason: the onboarding wizard shows the flow
 * inline and waits for `useGithubConnection` to re-check on window focus.
 * Navigating this tab away unmounts the wizard mid-onboarding and — since the
 * backend sends browser clients to /settings — drops the user out of setup
 * entirely.
 *
 * The tab is opened SYNCHRONOUSLY, before awaiting the install URL. Browsers
 * grant `window.open` only while user activation is live, and the fetch below
 * would spend it — so we claim the tab first and point it somewhere once we
 * know where. If the popup is blocked anyway, fall back to this tab: losing
 * wizard position beats the button doing nothing.
 *
 * The opened tab lands on the backend callback, which 302s browser clients to
 * /settings?github=connected. useClosePopupAfterGithub (App.tsx) notices it
 * is a popup and closes it, returning focus here — which is exactly the
 * signal the wizard is waiting for.
