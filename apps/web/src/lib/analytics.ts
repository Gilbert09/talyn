/**
 * PostHog analytics for the browser app.
 *
 * Imports the `module.full.no-external` bundle plus `posthog-recorder`, so the
 * SDK *and* the session-replay recorder are fully inlined. The desktop does
 * this because its renderer is served from `file://` under a strict CSP; the
 * web app keeps it because that same choice is what lets `script-src 'self'`
 * hold here with no CDN exemption (see vercel.json). Lazily fetching the
 * recorder from PostHog's CDN would be blocked and replay would silently
 * never start.
 *
 * A small guarded helper module rather than the React provider, so calls are
 * safe no-ops until PostHog is initialised. Analytics is disabled entirely
 * until VITE_TALYN_POSTHOG_KEY is set at build time.
