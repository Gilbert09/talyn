/**
 * Panel ⇄ URL mapping.
 *
 * The desktop switches on a zustand `activePanel` enum in MainLayout and has
 * no URLs at all. The store stays the source of truth in the fork too — it
 * drives transitions imperatively (onboarding completion) in a way that would
 * be awkward to express as a navigation — but each panel now also has a path,
 * kept in sync by usePanelUrlSync.
 *
 * (The other imperative transition this used to cite — bouncing off the Debug
 * panel when debug mode was switched off — went away with the panel itself,
 * which now lives on admin.talyn.dev.)
