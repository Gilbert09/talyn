/**
 * Decides whether to open the "What's new" modal on launch.
 *
 * The version this client last showed lives in localStorage, per device — like
 * the theme and the auto-keep explainer. It gates an explainer, not an
 * entitlement, so there is nothing here worth a schema column: the worst case
 * of losing it is one extra baseline read on a new machine.
 *
 * Three outcomes:
 *   - No stored version (first ever run): record the latest release and show
 *     nothing. A brand-new user wants the app, not a changelog.
 *   - Stored version, nothing notable since: record the new high-water mark
 *     and show nothing. Most nightlies land here.
 *   - Stored version with notable releases since: open the modal.
 *
 * A build whose version isn't a semver — which is every local build — opts out
 * of all three. Without a version there is no way to tell which releases this
 * build actually contains, and guessing in either direction is worse than
 * saying nothing: no ceiling shows features that aren't here, and recording a
 * baseline from a dev profile would swallow real notes later.
 *
 * Mounted once from MainLayout, which is inside the onboarding gate — so this
 * can never fire over the wizard.
