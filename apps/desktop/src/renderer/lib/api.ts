 * The desktop's binding of the shared backend client.
 *
 * The transport itself — every route, the WS client, the 401-retry — lives in
 * `@talyn/client` so the desktop renderer and the browser app can't drift
 * apart on the backend contract. All that's left here is the two things only
 * this host knows: where the backend is (webpack `EnvironmentPlugin` bakes
 * `TALYN_*` in at build time) and how a session is stored (Supabase, behind
 * the Electron safeStorage bridge).
 *
 * Everything is re-exported below, so the ~40 files that `import { api, … }
 * from '../lib/api'` are unaffected by the move.
