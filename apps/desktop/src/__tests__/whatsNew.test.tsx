 * open it.
 *
 * The interesting cases are all about NOT showing it: a first run, a nightly
 * with nothing user-facing, a release the running build hasn't installed yet,
 * and a second mount. Getting any of those wrong means a modal in front of a
 * user who has nothing to read.
 *
 * Duplicated in the other app on purpose: the renderer is a deliberate fork.
