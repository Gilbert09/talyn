/**
 * Every URL the console has, in one place.
 *
 * The single source of truth: `App.tsx` builds its `<Route path=…>` from these
 * and `nav.ts` links to them, so a test can assert that every nav destination
 * is a real route without re-listing the route table (a re-listing drifts, and
 * a drifted test asserts nothing).
 *
 * This is the deliberate, weaker substitute for the product apps' compile-time
 * guarantee. There, `PANEL_PATHS ... satisfies Record<ActivePanel, string>`
 * makes a panel without a URL a `tsc` error. That construct is a flat map of
 * STATIC paths with an exact-string reverse lookup, and it cannot express
 * `/fleet/runs/:runId` — so this app trades it for params plus a runtime check.
