/**
 * Filter state lives in the URL, not component state.
 *
 * A filtered view has to be a link an operator can paste into Slack — the same
 * reason drill-ins are routes rather than modals. The regression this pins is
 * the react-router analogue of the one `usePanelUrlSync`'s docblock records in
 * the product apps: a change that applies and then immediately reverts,
 * because two sources of truth are racing to write the same value.
