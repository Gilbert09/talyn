/**
 * Every sidebar link goes somewhere real.
 *
 * This is the RUNTIME REPLACEMENT for a compile-time guarantee this app gives
 * up on purpose. The product apps declare `PANEL_PATHS ... satisfies
 * Record<ActivePanel, string>`, so a panel with no URL fails `tsc`. Typing
 * `NavItem.to` as `RoutePath` recovers half of that — a link to a URL that does
 * not exist will not compile — but it cannot tell whether the route is actually
 * MOUNTED in App.tsx. An unmounted path silently matches the `*` fallback and
 * redirects, which looks to an operator like the link is broken rather than
 * missing.
