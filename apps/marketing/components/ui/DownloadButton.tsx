 * stops a double-click on ONE button and nothing else — and the page renders
 * up to seven of these (nav desktop, nav mobile, hero, mid CTA, pricing,
 * final CTA). A client that clicks several of them produces several events
 * from several refs, each of which has only ever seen one click.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical: in the week after the ref shipped the site still
 * recorded 1.8-2.25 `download_click` events per session, the pairs 0-1s
 * apart, and almost every one of those sessions has a replay with zero
 * recorded mouse movement. A shared latch is the only thing that sees both.
 *
 * The 4s reset is the original one and is unchanged: a download usually does
 * NOT unload the page, so a latch that only ever closes would leave every
 * button on the page dead for anyone who stays and wants another.
