# FastOwl Session Notes

Chronological notes from development sessions. Most recent first. See [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) for the project context and [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md) for the phased TODO.

## Session 42 — Admin-only, per-user debug panel

The debug bus exposed ALL backend traffic to any authenticated user (Session-question finding: a single global ring buffer, unscoped `/debug` routes, and a `broadcast()`-to-everyone `debug:event` sink). Locked it down and made it multi-tenant-aware so it can run in production limited to operators.

- **Admin gate**: new `users.is_admin` column (migration `0022`), surfaced on `AuthUser.isAdmin`. Granted via a `FASTOWL_ADMIN_EMAILS` bootstrap at login (promotes on token verify; never demotes) so no manual SQL is needed. New `requireAdmin` middleware guards every `/debug` route except `GET /debug/access` (which just reports `{admin}` so the desktop can hide the panel). The daemon internal-proxy identity is always non-admin.
- **Per-user attribution**: `DebugEvent` / `DebugRateLimitState` gain `ownerId`/`ownerLabel`. The github service registers `workspaceId → {ownerId, label}` (email or `@github`) at token load/connect; `recordHttp` / `recordRateLimit` pass `workspaceId` and the bus stamps the owner. `snapshot()` returns the `owners` list for the filter dropdown.
- **Filtering**: `getEvents`/`snapshot` take an owner filter (`<id>` | `system` | all); `/debug/events|snapshot?owner=` plumb it.
- **Optimised live stream**: the `debug:event` sink no longer `broadcast()`s to everyone — a dedicated fan-out sends only to **admin** clients, and only those whose per-client `debug:filter` matches the event's owner. So a non-admin gets nothing and an admin watching one user isn't fed everyone else's traffic over the wire. New `debug:filter` WS message + `ws.setDebugFilter()` (re-sent on reconnect).
- **Desktop**: DebugPanel gains a user-filter dropdown (All / System / per-account), re-fetches backfill + snapshot on change, pushes the WS filter, and shows an "admin-only" state when `/debug/access` says no.
- **To enable for yourself**: set `FASTOWL_ADMIN_EMAILS=<your login email>` in the backend `.env` and re-login.
- 14 new tests (debug bus attribution/filter + `matchesOwnerFilter`; WS admin-gating + owner-filter streaming). Full backend suite green (472), desktop (34).

## Session 41 — Global "core functionality missing" banner

Added an app-wide warning banner (full-width, top of `MainLayout`, above the sidebar) that surfaces when core functionality is unavailable — currently a disconnected GitHub, which silently pauses PR tracking, reviews, and the merge queue. Follows the silent-failure theme of Sessions 39–40: make the broken state loud instead of leaving the user to discover dead pollers.

- **`components/layout/SystemStatusBanner.tsx`**: renders a warning row per missing service (extensible array). For GitHub: distinguishes "configured but disconnected" (amber banner + **Connect GitHub** action that opens OAuth, plus a settings shortcut) from "OAuth not configured on the backend" (info, no action). Renders nothing while healthy or before the first status check (no flash).
- **`stores/workspace.ts`**: new `githubStatus` field + `setGitHubStatus` so the banner reacts app-wide without prop drilling.
- **`hooks/useSystemStatus.ts`**: mounts once in `MainLayout`, reuses `useGithubConnection` (fetch + on-focus re-check) and mirrors status into the store — so reconnecting via the browser clears the banner automatically.
- **`SettingsPanel.tsx`**: GitHub connect/disconnect now also writes the store, so an in-app disconnect surfaces the banner instantly (no focus event needed).
- 5 renderer tests (`SystemStatusBanner.test.tsx`) covering the show/hide matrix. Desktop suite green (34), tsc + lint clean.

## Session 40 — Surface GitHub token-load failures

Debugging a "no HTTP requests / no rate-limit tiles / pollers show 0 workspaces" report: the cause class is the backend loading **0 GitHub tokens** at startup, so `getConnectedWorkspaces()` is empty and every GitHub poller no-ops (0ms, no HTTP). The token-load failure was silent (only a `console.error` in `readAccessToken` on a decrypt failure — typically a `FASTOWL_TOKEN_KEY` mismatch vs. when the token was saved). Confirmed it's **not** a regression: no recent commit touched token loading / `getConnectedWorkspaces` / the integrations table (only the `workflow` scope constant changed).

- **`github.ts` `loadStoredTokens`**: now records a `tokens:loaded` debug event with `{loaded, failed, rows}` and an `ok:false` `tokens:load-failed` event on a hard failure, plus a clearer console summary (`Loaded N token(s) from M row(s) — K could not be read (likely a FASTOWL_TOKEN_KEY mismatch; reconnect GitHub to re-save)`). Makes the silent killer visible in the Debug panel's Events/Errors right after a restart, and distinguishes "no integration row" (need to connect) from "row present but undecryptable" (key mismatch → reconnect).

## Session 39 — Rate-limit tiles survive being rate-limited

Fixed the Debug panel's rate-limit cards vanishing after the account got rate-limited + the backend restarted. Root cause: `rateLimitPoller.tick()` called `getViewerLogin()` (a budgeted `/user` REST call) *first* and skipped the whole account if it failed — so when the account was rate-limited (or a restart wiped the in-memory login cache), the **free** `GET /rate_limit` was never fetched and the cards never repopulated. The cards live in an unpruned in-memory map, so they only clear on restart and then never came back.

- **`rateLimitPoller.ts`**: fetch `/rate_limit` unconditionally; the login is now a best-effort *label* only, falling back to `workspace <id8>` when it can't be resolved, so cards show even mid-rate-limit.
- **`debugBus.ts`**: prune rate-limit cards not re-observed within 3 min (≫ the 30s poll cadence). Makes cards honest if the poller/account goes away, and stops a relabelled fallback card lingering as a stale duplicate once the real login resolves.
- Note: cards are delivered via the 3s snapshot re-pull (`recordRateLimit` doesn't emit a live `debug:event`), so after enabling they populate within one poll tick.
- 4 new tests (2 poller tick label-resolution incl. the rate-limited fallback, 2 debugBus staleness pruning). Full backend suite green (461).

## Session 38 — Live merge-queue position badges

Fixed the `Queued #N` badge going stale: positions only ever updated on a manual list refresh because the live `pull_request:updated` events carried a placeholder position (the toggle route emitted `position: 0`, the processor `position: 1`), and nothing recomputed the *sibling* PRs' positions when the group's membership changed (enqueue, dequeue, merge).

- **`services/mergeQueueBroadcast.ts`** (new): single source of truth for queue position math — `computeQueuePositions(rows)` (1-based per `(repo, base)` group, FIFO by `mergeQueuedAt`) plus `broadcastMergeQueuePositions(workspaceId)`, which reloads the workspace's queued open PRs, recomputes, and emits a `pull_request:updated` per PR with its real position.
- **Wired the rebroadcast into every membership change**: the merge-queue toggle route (after enqueue/dequeue — dequeue also emits the toggled PR's cleared badge), the processor's merge-success path (survivors shift #2→#1), and the processor's `dequeue` (PR merged/closed upstream).
- **De-duped** the position logic: `routes/pullRequests.ts` now imports the shared `computeQueuePositions` for its GET list instead of a local copy, so the badge order can't drift from the order PRs actually merge.
- Also reduced the merge-queue poll interval 60s → 10s, and added the `workflow` OAuth scope so merges in large repos (PostHog/posthog) stop 403-ing on GitHub's workflow gate-check timeout (requires reconnecting GitHub).
- 5 new tests (2 broadcast integration via emit-spy, 3 parameterised `computeQueuePositions`). Full backend suite green.

## Session 37 — "Copy list" of filtered PRs

Added a **Copy list** button to the GitHub page header that copies the currently filtered PRs to the clipboard for pasting into Slack to request approvals. Writes a rich `text/html` bullet list of hyperlinks (Slack/Notion/docs paste as clickable links) plus a plain-text markdown fallback (`- [title](url)`) via a single `ClipboardItem`; falls back to `writeText(markdown)` where `ClipboardItem` isn't available. Respects every active filter (relationship/repo/search/needs-attention) since it copies off `filtered`. Toast reports the count. `GitHubPanel.tsx` only.

## Session 36 — First-run onboarding wizard

Replaced the (non-existent) onboarding with a guided, full-screen first-run wizard, fixing the dead first run the cloud-only/PR pivot left behind. Previously the app silently auto-created a "Default Workspace" on first load, dropped the user on the empty Inbox, and buried every real setup step (connect GitHub, watch repos, connect a cloud provider) in Settings.

- **Wizard** (`apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/onboarding/`): `OnboardingWizard.tsx` owns step state + a step indicator + Back/Next/Skip/Finish footer; four step components — `WorkspaceNameStep` (creates + selects the first workspace, replacing the silent default), `ConnectGitHubStep` (required; OAuth in browser, detected on focus), `WatchReposStep` (skippable-with-hint), `ConnectPostHogStep` (optional cloud agent).
- **Gate** (`App.tsx`): `AuthedApp` renders `<OnboardingWizard/>` vs `<MainLayout/>` off a new persisted `onboardingComplete` flag, waiting on a `loaded` signal from `useInitialDataLoad` so returning users never flash the wizard.
- **Store** (`stores/workspace.ts`): `onboardingComplete` flag + `setOnboardingComplete` setter, hand-rolled localStorage (`fastowl-onboarding-complete`) like the theme/debug flags.
- **Data load** (`hooks/useApi.ts`): removed the silent "Default Workspace" auto-create; added a first-load-only migration (ref-guarded so the wizard's own workspace doesn't trip it) that marks existing users onboarded; exposed `loaded`.
- **Reuse**: extracted the repo-list cache helpers into `lib/repoCache.ts` (shared key with the Settings card) and the GitHub status/focus-recheck loop into `hooks/useGithubConnection.ts`. Workspace typechecks + lints clean.

## Session 35 — Merge queue

Added a FastOwl-orchestrated **merge queue**: queue up a stack of PRs and they merge one-by-one, serialized per `(repo, base branch)`, with conflicts/behind-branches auto-fixed by the same cloud run the auto-keep-mergeable watcher uses. Solves the base-branch race — merging from the app no longer means hand-merging one PR, waiting for the base to settle, then merging the next.

- **Shared helpers** (`services/prCloudFix.ts`): extracted `resolvePostHogEnvId` + `linkedTaskStatus` + `ACTIVE_STATUSES` out of `prAutoMergeWatcher` so both background services share one copy.
- **Processor** (`services/mergeQueueProcessor.ts`): 60 s poller, mirrors the watcher. Each tick loads queued open PRs FIFO by `merge_queued_at`, groups by `(workspace, repo, base)`, and acts only on each group's head — one head per group + the single-threaded `ticking` guard + a synchronous awaited merge means two same-base PRs never both merge in a tick, while distinct bases/repos proceed in parallel. Per head: refresh stale state → merge if clean (`githubService.mergePullRequest`, drop off the queue, promote the next) → else fire the shared `buildPostHogPrompt` cloud run (which merges the base in, curing both conflicts and `BEHIND`), wait via the active-task guard, retry, blocked after 3 attempts. `merged:false` / thrown merge → stay queued and record the error.
- **The race fix**: `prNeedsFollowup` misses `BEHIND`/`BLOCKED` (exactly the post-merge state of every sibling PR), so a `needsUpdate` check funnels those into the same fix path.
- **API + DB**: migration `0021_pr_merge_queue` (`merge_queued` bool, `merge_queued_at` for FIFO order, `merge_method`, `merge_queue_state` jsonb, partial index). New `POST /pull-requests/:id/merge-queue` toggle; list endpoint computes 1-based per-group `position`; `reconcileTerminalState` drops closed/merged PRs off the queue. Queue state flows through PR payloads + the `pull_request:updated` WS event.
- **Desktop**: "Add to merge queue" toggle + status indicator on the PR detail-sheet header and a row action/badge (`Queued #N` / `Merging` / `Fixing` / `Blocked`) on the GitHub list.
- 13 new parameterised processor tests (real pglite DB, `mergePullRequest` spied) covering clean-merge, conflict→fix, BEHIND→fix, serialization, different-base parallelism, attempt cap, re-arm, `merged:false`, thrown merge, no-env, and ignore-non-queued. Full backend suite green (412 tests). Workspace typechecks + lints clean.

## Session 34 — Per-PR "auto-keep mergeable" watcher

Added an opt-in, per-PR toggle that keeps a PR mergeable unattended and indefinitely: a background watcher repeatedly fires the existing "take this PR to a clean, mergeable state" cloud run whenever the PR has a blocker (conflicts / failing required CI / changes-requested / unresolved review threads), never two at once, and keeps watching after the PR is clean so a conflict that appears days later is auto-fixed too.

- **Shared helpers** (`packages/shared/src/prMergeable.ts`): moved `prNeedsFollowup` / `buildIssuesSummary` / `buildPostHogPrompt` out of `GitHubPanel.tsx` so the manual button and the watcher build the *identical* task. The prompt builder is now parameterised (`{ owner, repo, number, summary }`).
- **Watcher** (`services/prAutoMergeWatcher.ts`): 60 s poller over `pull_requests WHERE auto_keep_mergeable AND state='open'`. Per PR: refresh stale summaries (`prMonitor.refreshPr`), skip if a linked run is active, fold the last auto-run's outcome into an attempt counter, re-arm on a mergeable observation, then fire via the shared `createCloudTask` helper. Runaway guard: pause after 3 consecutive un-mergeable auto-runs; reaching mergeable resets the counter (chosen over digest-based re-arm because the agent's own pushes change the digest).
- **Task creation** factored into `services/taskCreate.ts` (`createCloudTask`), shared by `POST /tasks` and the watcher.
- **API + DB**: migration `0020_pr_auto_keep_mergeable` (boolean `auto_keep_mergeable` + `auto_merge_state` jsonb + partial index). New `POST /pull-requests/:id/auto-keep-mergeable`; flag + compact watcher state flow through PR payloads and the `pull_request:updated` WS event.
- **Desktop**: toggle in the PR detail-sheet header (gated on PostHog Code connected) + "Watching"/"Paused" badge on the PR list row.
- 8 new parameterised watcher tests (real pglite DB) covering the decision matrix; full backend suite green (407 tests). Workspace typechecks + lints clean.

## Session 33 — Cloud-only pivot: strip local execution, build the CloudTaskProvider seam

Refocused FastOwl as a **PR-management app that delegates to cloud coding agents**. Ripped out the entire local-execution layer and folded PostHog Code into a pluggable provider abstraction. Landed as a series of small commits:

1. **Provider seam + cloud-only task queue.** New `services/cloudProviders/` (`types`, `registry`, generic `poller`). PostHog Code wrapped as `cloudProviders/posthog/provider.ts` (delegates to the existing `posthogCode/*` executor/streamer/poller — no rewrite). `taskQueue` lost the idle-agent/(env,repo)-slot/git-prep machinery; it now resolves a task's cloud-marker env → provider → `dispatch`. Neutral `CloudTaskMetadata` + `readCloudTaskMeta`/`readCloudTaskProvider` helpers in shared (legacy `posthog*` fields read through them).
2. **Generic `/api/v1/cloud-providers` route** + reusable `ensureCloudEnvironment` helper. `/posthog` kept as a back-compat alias for the existing Settings card.
3. **Strip.** Deleted the daemon services (registry/ws/proxy/auto-update) + `/daemon-ws`, agent/agentStructured/claudeCli/ai (local Claude spawning), permission service/hook/inbox, backlog + continuousBuild, git/gitContext/gitLogService/taskCommitSnapshot/taskFileWatcher, and the agents/permission/backlog/daemon routes. Slimmed `routes/tasks.ts` to the cloud surface and `routes/environments.ts` to list+delete. `taskPullRequest` → dormant stub. Deleted `packages/daemon`, the shared `daemonProtocol`, and the daemon CI. Desktop: removed the local-daemon lifecycle (main IPC/menu/preload), `useLocalDaemon`, `AddEnvironmentModal`, and the Settings Environments/Continuous-Build sections.
4. **Schema collapse** (migration `0017_cloud_only`): wiped tasks, dropped `agents`/`backlog_*` tables, slimmed `environments` to a secret-free marker, dropped `tasks.assigned_agent_id`/`terminal_output`.
5. **CLI/MCP**: dropped backlog commands/tools + `mark_ready_for_review`.

Full workspace typechecks; 365 backend tests pass. Design + remaining work (Codex Cloud, Claude Routines) in [`CLOUD_PROVIDERS.md`](./CLOUD_PROVIDERS.md). Note: the daemon-everywhere / continuous-build roadmaps are now superseded.

## Session 32 — Link PR-fix tasks to their PR row + live in-progress indicator

Starting a task from a PR row ("Get PR mergeable" / "Address PR") now **associates the task with that `pull_requests` row**, and the GitHub list shows a status-aware badge on the row that deep-links to the task.

- **Linking.** `CreateTaskRequest` gains optional `pullRequestId`. New `attachTaskToPullRequestRow()` in `prCache.ts` sets `task_id` by row id (workspace-scoped; **overwrites** any prior link so the row tracks the *active* fix task — the reverse of `linkTaskToPullRequest`, which is sticky for PRs a task *opens*) and emits `pull_request:updated`. The tasks `POST` route links best-effort (fire-and-forget) after insert.
- **Indicator.** `PRTableRow` reads the linked task's live status from the workspace store (`task:status` keeps it current). Shows **"Working"** (spinner) while `pending/queued/in_progress`, **"Review"** (amber) while `awaiting_review`, and **nothing** once `completed/failed/cancelled` — matching "indicator while running, gone when complete". Unknown/unloaded status falls back to a plain "Task" badge so the link isn't lost. Clicking opens the task (`selectTask` + Queue panel).
- **Button gating.** The start-task buttons suppress while a task is active on the row (create-task hidden via `!taskActive`; "Get PR mergeable" disabled with a clearer tooltip) so you can't double-launch. Both create handlers pass `pullRequestId` and optimistically set the row's `taskId` so the badge appears instantly. The `pull_request:updated` handler now patches `taskId`.
- **Tests.** 4 new `attachTaskToPullRequestRow` cases (set+emit, overwrite, unknown-id no-op, cross-workspace refusal). prCache suite green (32 tests); typecheck + lint clean across shared/backend/desktop.

## Session 31 — Instant PR panel switching (seed-from-cache) + Esc to close

Switching PRs felt laggy because `PRDetailSheet` blocked on a full `GET /pull-requests/:id` round-trip every time. Now the list passes the already-loaded row (`seedRow`) into the panel; the panel renders that cached summary **instantly** (title, branch, status pill, check rollup) and refreshes the live detail (reviews/files/check rows/body) in place.

- **`view` selection** (`useMemo`): the fetched `data` once it matches the current `pullRequestId`, else the `seedRow` while the fetch is in flight. An id guard stops the previous PR's detail flashing during a switch (and the `pull_request:updated` WS patch now also guards `prev.row.id === p.id`).
- **Minimal spinner**: a small `Loader2` next to the title while `detailPending` (current PR's detail fetch unresolved), instead of a full-panel "Loading…". Threaded into `OverviewTab` ("Loading description…") and `ChecksTab` ("Loading checks…") so they show a spinner rather than the empty/"unavailable"/GitHub-fallback states while loading. The "Detail fetch unavailable" note only shows once the fetch resolves empty.
- **Esc closes the panel** (`keydown` listener, both layouts). QueuePanel's overlay usage passes no `seedRow`, so it keeps the original full-loading behaviour — unchanged except it now also closes on Esc.

## Session 30 — Fix: switching the open PR detail panel from the list

The Session 28 "shift the list left" margin hack didn't actually fix switching — `marginRight: min(42rem, 100%)` collapses the list to zero width on any content area ≤ 42rem (common at typical window sizes), so rows still weren't clickable and the panel never switched. Replaced it with a real split layout: on the GitHub page the `PRDetailSheet` now renders as an **in-flow flex sibling** beside the list (new `layout="inline"` prop) instead of a `fixed` overlay, so the list keeps `flex-1` width and stays clickable; clicking another PR changes `selectedId` and the already-mounted sheet refetches. `QueuePanel` keeps the default `layout="overlay"` (unchanged). The sheet's container class switches between `h-full shrink-0` (inline) and the original `fixed inset-y-0 right-0 z-40 shadow-2xl` (overlay).

## Session 29 — Replace hand-rolled markdown with react-markdown

Ripped out the bespoke `renderMarkdownish` parser (`apps/desktop/src/renderer/lib/markdown.tsx`) and rebuilt it on **react-markdown + remark-gfm + rehype-raw + rehype-sanitize**. The hand-rolled parser kept hitting gaps on real PR/review content (tables, then `<details>` — patched twice); the library handles GFM (tables, task lists, strikethrough, autolinks) and raw HTML for free, sanitized.

- **Same public API.** `renderMarkdownish(text, variant)` is now a thin shim over a new `<Markdown text variant />` component, so all four call sites (`AgentConversation` feed, `PRDetailSheet` surface ×3) are unchanged. The `feed`/`surface` palette split is preserved via a per-variant `components` map (links, code/pre, headings, lists, blockquote, hr, tables, details/summary, img).
- **Safety.** `rehype-raw` → `rehype-sanitize` (extended `defaultSchema` to allow `<details>`/`<summary open>`) so untrusted GitHub HTML renders without XSS.
- **Jest + ESM.** react-markdown's plugin tree is pure ESM and breaks ts-jest's CommonJS transform — followed the repo's existing pattern (the `@pierre/diffs/react` mock) and stubbed `react-markdown` / `remark-gfm` / `rehype-raw` / `rehype-sanitize` via `moduleNameMapper` + `.erb/mocks/*`. Markdown-rendering correctness now relies on react-markdown's upstream tests; our jest test is a wrapper smoke test (the old DOM-level table/details tests were removed since the renderer is mocked). Verified the real bundle with a production `build:renderer` (webpack resolves the ESM cleanly).

## Session 28 — PR detail panel polish (checks filter, reviews experience, panel switching)

Four UX improvements to the PR detail side-panel (`PRDetailSheet`) and the GitHub list:

- **Checks tab — tile filters.** The Passed/Failed/Running/Skipped rollup tiles are now toggle buttons (`CheckCountTile` → `<button>` with `aria-pressed` + ring highlight). Clicking one filters the per-check list to that state; clicking again clears. Tiles with a zero count are disabled.
- **Checks tab — failed first.** The per-check list is sorted by a fixed state rank (`failure → in_progress → pending → success → skipped`, unknown states last) so anything needing attention sits at the top.
- **Reviews tab — full GitHub-like experience.** New backend endpoint `GET /pull-requests/:id/reviews` (`fetchPRReviewDetail` / `decodeReviewDetail` in `githubGraphql.ts`) does one GraphQL round-trip for every submitted review (with body), every inline review thread (grouped, with diff hunk + resolved/outdated state), and the top-level conversation comments — all with author avatars and markdown bodies. The tab fetches this on open and renders Reviews / Inline comments (unresolved-first, with an unresolved count) / Conversation sections. Replaced the old terse `ActivityList` link-outs.
- **PR list — switch the open panel.** The detail panel overlays the right edge; the GitHub list now shifts left (`marginRight: min(42rem, 100%)`) while a PR is selected, so every row stays visible and clicking another PR switches the panel.

New renderer API types: `PRReviewDetail` / `PRReviewThread` / `PRReviewThreadComment` / `PRReviewDetailReview` / `PRConversationComment` + `pullRequests.reviews(id)`. Five new `decodeReviewDetail` tests (filtering, sort order, diff-hunk extraction). Typecheck + lint clean, backend suite green.

## Session 27 — "Get PR mergeable" follow-up button + unresolved-comment count

Added a one-click way to dispatch a **PostHog Code** cloud run that takes a PR to a clean, mergeable state (resolve every review comment, get CI green, resolve conflicts — looping until all three hold). Modelled on the `task-script/pr_review_followup/create_pr_tasks.py` prompt.

- **Unresolved review thread count surfaced in the GitHub list.** Extended the batched GraphQL fetch (`services/githubGraphql.ts`) with an aliased `unresolvedThreads: reviewThreads(first: 100) { nodes { isResolved } }`, counting unresolved into a new `PRSummary.unresolvedReviewThreads`. Persisted through `prCache` (`summaryToJsonb` / `rowToSummary` / placeholder) and exposed on the renderer `PRSummaryShape` (optional, for rows cached before the field existed). Rendered as an amber `MessageSquare N` badge next to the Status pill in `GitHubPanel`.
- **The button** sits in the row action cluster, immediately left of the copy-branch button. Only rendered when PostHog Code is connected for the workspace *and* the PR is open; disabled (greyed) unless the PR actually has something to fix — `prNeedsFollowup()` = merge conflicts ∥ changes-requested ∥ failing checks ∥ `unresolvedReviewThreads > 0`.
- **Dispatch path:** builds the full follow-up prompt (`buildPostHogPrompt`) and creates a `pr_response` task with `assignedEnvironmentId` = the auto-provisioned `posthog_code` env, which the task queue already routes to `dispatchTaskToPostHogCode`. Then jumps to the new task. PostHog status is fetched via `api.posthog.getStatus`; the cloud env id comes from the workspace store.
- **Tests:** two new decode cases in `githubGraphql.test.ts` (counts unresolved; defaults to 0 when absent); updated the three `PRSummary` test builders. Full backend suite green (117).

## Session 26 — PostHog Code: cloud execution provider

Added **PostHog Code** as a new way to run tasks — a `posthog_code` environment type that delegates the entire agent loop to PostHog's sandboxed cloud runners instead of driving Claude locally over a daemon. Landed in two commits (backend, then desktop UI).

**The key insight:** PostHog Code is a *delegation* provider, not a daemon transport. FastOwl's existing model drives the agent itself (spawns `claude -p`, parses JSONL, branches git, auto-commits → `awaiting_review`). PostHog Code instead owns the whole loop on its own machine (clones repo, runs agent, commits, pushes, opens a PR). So FastOwl's role becomes **create → poll → ingest the PR**. It's a new execution provider at the task-queue level, *not* a new entry in the daemon `stream_spawn`/`git` wire protocol.

**API used** (`{host}/api/projects/{projectId}`, `Authorization: Bearer <personal key>`): `POST /tasks/` (create), `POST /tasks/{id}/run/` (`{mode:'background', runtime_adapter, model}`), `GET /tasks/{id}/` → `latest_run.{status, branch, output, error_message, log_url}`. Run status enum `not_started|queued|in_progress|completed|failed|cancelled`. PostHog auto-detects the opened PR URL and attaches it to the task, so we scan the task/run JSON for the first `github.com/.../pull/N`.

- **Backend** (`services/posthogCode/`): `client.ts` (typed REST), `credentials.ts` (per-workspace key stored encrypted on the existing `posthog` integration row, reusing `tokenCrypto`), `executor.ts` (create remote task + start run, stash `posthogTaskId/posthogRunId` on `task.metadata`, idempotent), `poller.ts` (10s reconcile of in-flight runs → `awaiting_review` when a PR opened, else `completed`; `failed`/`cancelled` → `failed`; links the PR via `linkTaskToPullRequest` so it flows into the existing PR monitor + inbox).
- **Task queue fork:** `posthog_code` tasks bypass the idle-agent / `(env,repo)` slot / concurrency machinery entirely (no working-tree contention in the cloud — concurrency control dropped by design) and are excluded from stuck-recovery (they have no FastOwl agent). Cloud envs are opt-in: excluded from the "any connected env" default pick.
- **Auth model:** key + project id live **per workspace** (the `posthog` integration row); the env is a secret-free marker. Created/booted as `connected` with no pairing.
- **Routes:** `/posthog` workspace-credential CRUD — key is write-only over the API and validated (`ping`) before persist.
- **Desktop:** Add-Environment "PostHog Code (cloud)" option; Settings → Integrations PostHog Code card; Create-Task runtime/model overrides when a cloud env is picked; a cloud-run banner (status + log link) in the task detail. PR pill renders from `metadata.pullRequest` once the poller links it.

**Open follow-ups:** confirm the exact PR-URL field against a live response (currently regex-scans the whole task/run JSON); optional live transcript via the `GET …/runs/{id}/stream/` SSE endpoint (left a clean seam, not built — decision was status+final-result only).

**Test note:** full backend suite shows ~22 `PGlite is closed` cleanup failures under the parallel run (pre-existing infra flakiness); all touched files pass clean in isolation (taskQueueProcess 9/9, environments+tasks+environmentService 65/65).

## Session 25 — GitHub page: bug fixes, row actions, unread dots, review-requested PRs

Continuation of the Conductor-parity work, focused on the GitHub page (`GitHubPanel.tsx`) after a full assessment of its bugs/gaps (#1–#9). Landed in four commits:

- **Quick fixes + table polish (#1 #2 #3 #9).** Refresh now triggers a real GitHub force-poll (`repositories.forcePoll()`) then re-reads the cache — previously it only re-read the local DB, so "Refresh" never actually hit GitHub. Added a "Connect GitHub" empty state (via `github.getStatus`) so a disconnected workspace no longer shows the same misleading "no PRs match" message as a connected-but-empty one. Sortable Updated column, live counts on the Open / Needs-attention pills, keyboard-navigable rows, a Task badge that deep-links to its task, and fixed the stale tabs doc comment.
- **Row actions (#8).** Each PR row reveals on hover a squash-merge action (confirm-gated, shown only when GitHub reports the PR mergeable, reusing `pullRequests.merge`) and a create-task action that spins up a `pr_response` task for the PR and jumps to it.
- **Unread indicators (#7).** A blue dot + count on PRs with unread activity. Derived with **zero schema change** from unread `inbox_items` linked to a PR via the existing `data->>'prUrl'` jsonb key (there's no inbox→PR FK). The list route (`GET /pull-requests`) now returns `unreadCount` per row via one grouped query; opening a PR clears the dot and flips its inbox items to read via new `POST /pull-requests/:id/seen`; an `inbox:new` WS event bumps the dot live. +4 route tests.
- **Review-requested PRs (#4).** The monitor previously watched only PRs authored by the connected user. It now also watches PRs where the user is a requested reviewer (`requested_reviewers` from the REST list), persisting a new `review_requested` boolean column (migration `0014`). `pollRepo` widens the filter and threads the flag through `upsertFromBatchResult` → `upsertRow`. `sweepClosed` gained a guard: a review-requested PR drops off the watch list the moment the user reviews it but stays OPEN on GitHub, so we no longer wrongly mark still-open PRs closed. The list route gained a `relationship=authored|review_requested|all` filter, the page a Mine/Review/All pill group, and review-requested rows a purple "Review" badge. +6 tests (3 monitor, 1 route filter, plus sweep-guard + flag assertions).

**Migration note:** `drizzle-kit generate` is currently broken by a pre-existing snapshot collision in `meta/`, unrelated to this change — `0014_pr_review_requested.sql` + the `_journal.json` entry were hand-written to match convention (the runtime postgres migrator only reads the journal + `.sql` files).

**Recovered session:** this work resumed a prior session (`03099785…`) that crashed mid-research on a `thinking`-block API error before writing any code.

## Session 24 — Conductor-parity polish (feed perf, PR diffs, merge, markdown)

Kicked off after comparing the task view against Conductor (conductor.build). Goal: close the "feels buggy / lower quality" gap. Full assessment + remaining backlog in [`docs/QUALITY_PARITY.md`](./QUALITY_PARITY.md). Landed in four commits:

- **Feed performance (the main "sluggish" cause).** Every stream-json `task:event` did an O(n) dedup + O(n log n) re-sort of the whole transcript AND triggered a full React re-render — dozens of times a second during a turn. Now: `task:event` is buffered per task in `useApi.ts` and flushed once per frame (`setTimeout(40ms)` so it survives backgrounding); append is the hot path, re-sort only on a detected out-of-order seq; drains on teardown. `BlockView` in `AgentConversation.tsx` is now `React.memo`'d with a cheap render-affecting signature (`blockSignature`) so a transcript update only re-renders the live streaming tail + any mutating permission card, not every settled block.
- **PR file diffs in-app.** `GET /pull-requests/:id/files` exposes the previously-dead `githubService.getPRFiles`. The `PRDetailSheet` Files tab now fetches the list, shows a changed-files summary (count + total +/-), and renders each file's diff inline via `@pierre/diffs` `PatchDiff` (the same viewer the task Files tab uses) in an expandable accordion. GitHub's hunks-only `patch` is wrapped in a synthesised `diff --git`/`---`/`+++` header (`toUnifiedDiff`) so added/removed files render as pure inserts/deletes. +4 route tests.
- **In-app merge + per-check breakdown.** `POST /pull-requests/:id/merge` (squash default) wraps `githubService.mergePullRequest` and force-refetches so the row flips to merged immediately. The sheet shows a green Merge button only for an open, mergeable PR, behind a two-step confirm. **This deliberately reverses the Phase-7 decision** to make all PR writes deep-links — merge is now the one in-app write path; review/comment composition still deep-links out. Per-check rows (`checkContexts`: name, normalized state, link) are now exposed on the live `PRSummary` detail fetch (data was already normalized for the rollup counts; not persisted to the cached summary, so no DB bloat) and rendered as individual rows in the Checks tab. +1 graphql decode assertion.
- **Richer markdown in the feed.** `renderMarkdownish` (still dependency-free) now covers headings, bullet/numbered lists, blockquotes, horizontal rules, and an inline parser for `**bold**`, `*italic*`, `[links](url)`, and `` `code` ``. Unrecognised input still falls through as a plain paragraph.

**Already-fixed-in-code backlog items** confirmed during the sweep: the "duplicate Stop button" (QueuePanel intentionally renders none — TaskTerminal owns Finish/Abort) and the "non-functional inbox 3-dot menu" (fully wires markRead/archive/delete) were both already resolved.

**Deferred** (need backend contract work — see QUALITY_PARITY.md): composer model picker + attachments (adding non-functional UI would reintroduce the placeholder feeling we're removing), a true simultaneous 3-pane layout (the PR sheet overlay already gives task→PR continuity), and desktop component/E2E test coverage.

## Session 23 — PR / CI tracking rebuild (Phases 1–7)

Replaces the per-PR-REST-fan-out poller + the lone PRListWidget with a batched-GraphQL DB-as-cache pipeline plus a real GitHub page and a task-screen status pill. Inspired by supacode's `batchPullRequests` + `statusCheckRollup` design (see `docs/SUPACODE_COMPARISON.md`).

- **Phase 1 — schema + GraphQL helper.** `pull_requests` table (DB-as-cache: minimal jsonb summary + cursors, no per-check rows, no raw payload). `services/githubGraphql.ts` with `batchPullRequests` (chunks of 25, up to 3 concurrent queries), `normalizeCheckState` (collapses GitHub's three-axis status/conclusion/state into one verdict), `computeBlockingReason` (mergeable + mergeStateStatus + reviewDecision + checks.failed → mergeable | merge_conflicts | changes_requested | checks_failed | blocked | unknown), `computeCheckDigest` (hash of head_sha + sorted check states for cheap "checks changed?" detection).
- **Phase 2 — prCache + cursor deltas.** `services/prCache.ts` with `getOrFetchPRSummary` (TTL hit / GraphQL fetch on miss), `forceFetchAndUpsert` (always GraphQL), `upsertFromBatchResult` (caller already has summary), and pure `computePRDeltas` (walks freshest-first arrays up to the persisted cursor; avoids re-emitting CI-failure on a still-failing PR via digest scan). Rewrote `services/prMonitor.ts`: removed the in-memory state map (lost on every restart, the source of "unread events vanishing on deploy"), per-tick REST list of user-authored open PRs filtered by `currentUserLogin`, batch-fetch stale ones via GraphQL, sweep-closed for rows that disappear from the open list. Same four inbox types preserved.
- **Phase 3 — read routes + WS.** Four `/api/v1/pull-requests` endpoints (list / get / refresh / focus). New `pull_request:updated` WS event fires on every upsert. Detail endpoint returns the persisted row + a fresh GraphQL fetch for recentReviews/comments (cache fallback when GraphQL is down).
- **Phase 4 — task-screen pill.** `widgets/PRStatusPill.tsx` (blocking-reason variants + 5-segment check rollup bar), `widgets/PRDetailSheet.tsx` (slide-in side panel — skeleton in this phase, tabs in Phase 5). Wired into `QueuePanel` task header. `prCache.linkTaskToPullRequest` seeds the row at PR-open time with task_id (race-safe), so the pill resolves the linked PR via `task.metadata.pullRequest.id`.
- **Phase 5 — GitHub page rebuild.** Replaces `PRListWidget` (deleted in Phase 7) with a real table + filter bar (state pills / repo dropdown / needs-attention / search). Side-sheet got Overview / Checks / Reviews / Files tabs. WS-driven row patching (no full refetch on every event).
- **Phase 6 — adaptive polling.** `services/prFocus.ts` — in-memory focus + 5s post-refresh cooldown registry. `prMonitor.filterStale` consults `ttlFor` per row (30s focused / 60s unfocused / Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER while in cooldown). Poll tick dropped to 30s. Desktop declares focus from both surfaces (task screen pill + GitHub-page detail sheet).
- **Phase 7 — cleanup.** Deleted `PRListWidget` + `PRDetailModal` + every `api.github.*` PR-management method (list/get/files/checks/create/merge/review/comment) + the matching backend routes. `githubService.createPullRequest` stays (used by `openPullRequestForTask`). Aligned `InboxItemType` with what the backend emits (`pr_review`, `pr_comment`, `ci_failure`, `pr_ready`) — was previously `pr_ci_failure` / `pr_ready_to_merge` and missing `pr_comment` entirely. Added the missing `pr_comment` icon to InboxPanel.

**Tests**: 147 across the new surface (38 GraphQL helpers, 22 prCache + 3 linkTaskToPullRequest, 8 prFocus, 18 prMonitor poll, 18 routes, 6 schema, plus 12 repo CRUD + 12 taskPullRequest + 10 routes/github survivors).

## Session 22 — Hardened auto-commit; refuse to advance silently

Re-litigates the "task hits awaiting_review with uncommitted files in the working tree" symptom. Forensic on the prod DB found two real shapes: (a) `metadata.autoCommit` getting silently overwritten when the commit DID happen — `autoCommitAndSnapshot`'s persist racing with the fire-and-forget `void recordGitCommand` writes from inner `gitService` calls, both doing un-serialized `SELECT metadata → modify → UPDATE`, last writer wins; (b) `commitAll` reporting `no-changes` even on a dirty working tree, with no signal in the UI and the task auto-advancing to `awaiting_review` where Reject would discard the work.

- **Per-task metadata mutex** (`services/taskMetadataMutex.ts`, new): `patchTaskMetadata(taskId, patch)` serializes every metadata RMW per-task. `gitLogService.recordGitCommand`, `taskCommitSnapshot.persistAutoCommitStatus`, `writeFinalFilesSnapshot`, `taskPullRequest.openPullRequestForTask` (success + error paths), and `taskQueue` rollback's `lastScheduleError` writer all route through the same chain. Atomic SQL `||` jsonb merges (agent.ts session_id_captured + runtime tag) stay as-is — they're already safe.

- **Hardened `autoCommitAndSnapshot`** (`services/taskCommitSnapshot.ts`): pre-flight `getPorcelainStatus` snapshot, post-commit verification, branch-ahead check via new `gitService.commitsAhead`. Result type grows an `advanceOk: boolean` contract — callers MUST honour it. New failure modes: `dirty-after-commit` (loud red banner, working tree still dirty after `add -A` + `commit`; most likely cause is wrong cwd or daemon misroute), `no-changes-no-commits` (clean tree but branch has 0 commits ahead of base — the agent didn't actually do anything), `wrong-branch` (couldn't switch HEAD onto the task branch). `no-changes` split into `no-changes-prior-commits` (advanceOk: true — Claude already committed) vs `no-changes-no-commits` (advanceOk: false). Every outcome persists a structured `metadata.autoCommit` record with reason, error message, and a porcelain preview.

- **Block the awaiting_review transition on hard failure**: `agent.handleStructuredExit`, `agent.maybeAutoFinishAgentTask`, and `POST /tasks/:id/ready-for-review` all check `result.advanceOk`. On false they leave the task in `in_progress` (not failed — failed exposes Reject which destroys the dirty tree) and emit `task:status` so the desktop re-renders. The route returns 409 with the reason instead of silently flipping to awaiting_review.

- **UI surface** (`QueuePanel.tsx`): three new banners above the tabs. Loud red on `in_progress + advanceOk=false` with a "Retry auto-commit" button (re-runs `/ready-for-review`, the same code path); subtle green on `awaiting_review + committed` showing sha + message; subtle amber on `awaiting_review + no-changes-prior-commits` ("branch already had commits — nothing new to add"). Hooks up to existing `useTaskActions().readyForReview`.

- **Tests**: `helperServices` autoCommit suite rewritten for the new shape — `advanceOk`, the four new failure modes (dirty-after-commit, no-changes-no-commits, wrong-branch, error), separate prior-commits-vs-no-commits assertions for the no-changes split. `tasksLifecycle` adds the 409 path on `advanceOk=false` and asserts the task stays `in_progress`. `agentLifecycle` mocks updated to the new result shape. All 572 backend tests pass; typecheck + lint clean.

## Session 21 — Split commit off approve; cache diffs on the transition

Moves the auto-commit + file-diff snapshot from `/approve` to the `in_progress → awaiting_review` transition. Motivation: the Files tab used to go blank once the env disconnected (because `getChangedFiles` is a live git query), and the working tree stayed dirty until the user approved, blocking back-to-back tasks on the same repo. With the snapshot persisted on the transition, the Files tab survives env offline, and the approve button shifts role — it's now "Create PR", the terminal step.

- **`autoCommitAndSnapshot(taskId)`** (`services/taskCommitSnapshot.ts`, new): checks out the task branch, regenerates the commit message via `generateCommitMessage`, runs `commitAll`, then persists a `{files[], perFileDiffs}` snapshot on `task.metadata.finalFiles` (per-file diff capped at 50 k chars). Same shape the old approve path wrote; overwrites on each call so follow-up rounds produce a fresh cumulative snapshot. Non-fatal on empty-changeset, env offline, or any git error — callers always transition.

- **Wired into all three `in_progress → awaiting_review` sites**: `POST /tasks/:id/ready-for-review`, `AgentService.handleStructuredExit` (one-shot clean exit), and `AgentService.maybeAutoFinishAgentTask` (interactive turn-complete auto-finish). Replaced the old `prefetchCommitMessage` fire-and-forget at each site; `services/commitMessagePrefetch.ts` and the `GET /tasks/:id/proposed-commit-message` route are gone.

- **`/approve` slimmed to push + PR + completed** (`routes/tasks.ts`): drops commit/snapshot logic (done earlier on the transition). Still calls `autoCommitAndSnapshot` as a safety net on entry — covers pre-refactor tasks, env-was-offline-at-transition tasks, and manual tweaks made in `awaiting_review`. Dirty-tree check remains as a post-push guard.

- **State-aware Files-tab routes** (`GET /tasks/:id/diff/files`, `/diff/file`): `completed` → snapshot only. `awaiting_review` → try live git, fall back to `metadata.finalFiles` if the env's offline or git throws. Everything else (in_progress etc.) → live only (no fallback, to avoid showing stale snapshots from a previous round). New `source: 'live' | 'cache'` field on the response; `useTaskFiles` surfaces it so the UI can indicate offline state later.

- **UI**: `QueuePanel.tsx` "Commit & push" button → "Create PR" (one-click, uses `GitPullRequest` icon). `ApproveTaskModal.tsx` deleted — commit message isn't user-editable anymore since the commit already happened. `api.tasks.approve` drops its `commitMessage` param; `proposeCommitMessage` is gone.

- **Tests**: helperServices — new `autoCommitAndSnapshot` suite covering all five `reason` branches, cumulative-snapshot overwrite on re-run, and non-throwing error surface. routes/tasks — new awaiting_review cache-fallback test, in_progress-doesn't-fall-back-to-stale-cache test, `source: 'live'` assertion on the live path. routes/tasksLifecycle — approve tests rewritten for push+PR semantics (no more commit exit-code scripting), new ready-for-review assertion that autoCommit fires, empty-changeset still transitions. All 564 backend + 98 daemon tests pass.

## Session 20 — Git-centric task flow (Phase 14.2–14.5)

Closes the loop on Phase 14: tasks now own their branch end-to-end, from a synced base at start through commit + push on approve. Landed together so each piece makes sense alongside the next — a partial slice here would leave tasks in a worse state than before.

- **`prepareTaskBranch` with base sync** (`gitService.ts`): one entry point for "start a task on this repo" — fetches the default branch, fast-forwards to origin, then creates `fastowl/<id>-<slug>` off it. Refuses to proceed if the tree is dirty (the slot guard should have prevented it) or if the base has diverged from origin (fails loud rather than branching off stale state). Wired into both `POST /tasks/:id/start` and `taskQueue.processQueue` — previously the scheduler's auto-pick path skipped branch setup entirely and edited whatever happened to be checked out.

- **(env, repo) single-slot guard** (`findTaskHoldingEnvRepoSlot` in `taskQueue.ts`): an `in_progress` or `awaiting_review` task holds the working tree for its `(assignedEnvironmentId, repositoryId)` pair. Scheduler skips queued tasks whose pair is held; `/start` returns 409. Awaiting-review keeps the slot because the working tree is still dirty with its work — approve or reject frees it.

- **`/approve` → commit + push** (`routes/tasks.ts`): new `gitService.commitAll` (staged via base64→stdin for arbitrary messages, no shell-escape concerns) + `pushBranch` + `getDiffStat`. Default commit message comes from `generateCommitMessage` in `services/ai.ts` — Claude Haiku 4.5, same pattern as `generateTaskTitle`, with the diff truncated to 6k chars. User can override via the approve modal's textarea or POST a `commitMessage` field. On push success, check out base and `git branch -D <task branch>` so the slot is free for the next task; remote branch stays.

- **`ApproveTaskModal`** (`components/modals/`): opens on Approve click; fetches the proposed message from `GET /tasks/:id/proposed-commit-message`, shows it in an editable textarea, submits `commitMessage` with the approve call. Shift-click bypasses the modal for users who trust the LLM.

- **`/reject` → stash to backup + reset tree**: new `gitService.stashToBackupRef` captures the current working tree (via `git stash create` + `update-ref`) into `refs/fastowl/rejected/<taskId>`, then `resetToBase` does `checkout -f` / `reset --hard origin/<base>` / `clean -fd`. The task goes back to `queued` with `branch` cleared so retry gets a fresh `prepareTaskBranch`. Rejected work is recoverable with `git checkout -b <name> refs/fastowl/rejected/<taskId>`.

- **Live file-change view** (Files tab). New `taskFileWatcher` service subscribes to `agentStructuredService`'s `event` stream, watches for `tool_use` blocks in `{Edit, Write, MultiEdit, NotebookEdit, Bash}`, debounces 500ms, runs `git diff --numstat` + `ls-files --others` on the task's env, and broadcasts a new `task:files_changed` WS event. New endpoints `GET /:id/diff/files` and `/diff/file?path=...` back the desktop UI. Terminal/Files tabs in the running-task view; Files tab replaces the inline diff in awaiting_review. Per-file diff viewer includes an in-flight-write pulse dot derived from unmatched `tool_use` events, and caps rendering at 2k lines. Old `TaskDiff.tsx` removed — `TaskFilesPanel` supersedes it.

Explicitly deferred: git worktrees (would drop the single-slot constraint but each worktree needs its own `node_modules` — monorepo pain), PR creation button, resume-task-on-different-env. See Phase 14.6/14.7 in ROADMAP.

## Session 19 — Daemon everywhere (Phase 18.5)

One-session refactor that collapses `local`/`ssh`/`daemon`/`coder` env types into `local | remote` with a single transport: every environment is backed by a `@fastowl/daemon` process dialling the backend over WebSocket. The immediate trigger: backend restart was SIGPIPE-killing local tasks because the child's stdin was piped directly to the backend process. The daemon now owns those pipes, so backend deploys don't take down in-flight work.

Eight slices, each a landable git push to `main`. Design doc: [`DAEMON_EVERYWHERE.md`](./DAEMON_EVERYWHERE.md) — kept as the live task list throughout.

- **Slice 1 — single-file daemon binary** (`8b26059`): `packages/daemon/scripts/build-binary.sh` + `.github/workflows/build-daemon-binaries.yml` cross-compile `bun build --compile` to five targets (darwin-arm64/x64, linux-x64/arm64, windows-x64) on one Ubuntu runner. `ws` + workspace imports work under `bun --compile`, verified by the smoke test that runs the linux binary with no args and checks the config-resolution error message.

- **Slice 2 — bundle binary in the Electron `.app`** (`4518746`): platform-specific `extraResources` entries in `apps/desktop/package.json` using `${arch}` macros; each packaged build pulls the matching binary from `packages/daemon/dist/fastowl-daemon-*` and drops it at `Contents/Resources/daemon/fastowl-daemon`. Root `npm run package` runs `build:binary:all -w @fastowl/daemon` before invoking electron-builder. `publish.yml` gains a `setup-bun` step.

- **Slice 3 — localDaemon install module** (`81bfb4a`): new `apps/desktop/src/main/localDaemon.ts`. macOS writes `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.fastowl.daemon.plist` (`KeepAlive=true`, `RunAtLoad=true`, logs to `~/Library/Logs/FastOwl/`) and calls `launchctl bootstrap gui/<uid>` — `bootout` first so re-install is idempotent. Linux writes `~/.config/systemd/user/fastowl-daemon.service` with `Restart=always` and runs `systemctl --user daemon-reload && enable --now`. Windows deferred. Dev mode spawns `tsx packages/daemon/src/index.ts` under Electron's lifetime for fast iteration.

- **Slice 4 — auto-pair on first launch** (`806bfef` + fixes): IPC handlers (`daemon:is-paired`, `daemon:host-label`, `daemon:configure-and-start`, `daemon:ensure-running`) in `main.ts`; preload bridge; renderer `useLocalDaemon()` hook in `AuthedApp`. Flow: after login, the hook creates a "This Mac (<hostname>)" env, mints a pairing token, hands it to main, main writes `~/.fastowl/daemon.json` + spawns/installs the daemon. Follow-ups landed same session: (a) daemon accepts `pairingToken` from the config file as a fallback (`141ccd3`); (b) `wss`/`daemonWss` routing fixed — the `{server, path: '/ws'}` auto-handler was aborting every non-`/ws` upgrade with 400, so the local daemon could never connect. Both WSS's are now `noServer: true`, dispatched by path in one handler. (c) `useLocalDaemon` looks up an existing "This Mac" env before creating, so failed pairs don't accumulate orphans (`6677b00`). (d) Local daemon env defaults to `autonomousBypassPermissions: false` (the override is for remote VMs) (`ad4ed76`).

- **Slice 5 — collapse env types** (`7907b35`): `EnvironmentType = 'local' | 'remote'`. Migration `0009_daemon_everywhere.sql` rewrites existing `daemon`-with-"This Mac" name → `local`, other `daemon` → `remote`, deletes stale `ssh`/`coder` rows. `services/environment.ts` rewritten ~200 LOC shorter — no switch on `env.type`, everything routes through `daemonRegistry`. Deleted: `services/ssh.ts`, `services/daemonInstaller.ts`, the SSH auto-install route, `docs/SSH_VM_SETUP.md`, `ssh2` + `@types/ssh2` deps. `AddEnvironmentModal` simplified from 626 → 210 LOC (one flow: name → pair → poll). SettingsPanel branches on `local`/`remote`. Dockerfile drops its `npm rebuild ssh2` step — backend now has zero native deps.

- **Slice 6 — session survival across backend restart** (`0cb795a`): the payoff. Daemon hello now carries `activeSessions: [{sessionId, pid, startedAt}]`. Backend `daemonRegistry` stores `liveSessionIds` per connected daemon, exposes `isSessionLive()` + `connectedEnvironmentIds()`, emits `daemon:connected`. `agent.cleanupStaleAgents` rewritten from "blanket-fail on boot" to a 60s-grace reconcile sweep with a fast path: once every expected env's daemon has dialled in, sweep immediately. Follow-up (`f93267e`): `agentStructuredService.resumeRun()` rehydrates per-run state from `tasks.transcript` + re-subscribes to session events, so surviving agents produce live UI events — not just stay alive. Final polish (`36fcc04`): `permission_token` column on agents + `permissionService.rehydrateRun()`; a child mid-PreToolUse at restart continues to authenticate.

- **Slice 7 — lifecycle surface + uninstall flow** (`02c1b5c`): Settings → Environments "This Mac" card shows launchd install + PID status, refreshes every 5s, has a Restart button. App menu → Daemon submenu with Restart + "Uninstall FastOwl daemon and quit…" (confirm dialog + full wipe). `scripts/fastowl-uninstall.sh` bundled via extraResources — usable from the `.app` or the repo for users who deleted the app before uninstalling.

- **Slice 8 — tests + docs**: new `agentReconcile.test.ts` covering the Slice 6 sweep (survivor kept / non-survivor failed / `isSessionLive` round-trip). Existing `daemonRegistry.test.ts` fixture updated for the new `liveSessionIds` required field. `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `CLAUDE.md` Core Concepts rewritten around the two-type, one-transport model. `ROADMAP.md` marks Phase 18.5 done; SSH + Coder types struck from Phase 1.2's env-type list.

**What this buys**:
- Backend restart / deploy no longer kills running tasks. Verified manually (`pkill -9` on the dev backend; task stays in_progress; output resumes). Single biggest day-to-day reliability win.
- One execution path. Every `env.type === '…'` switch across backend/desktop/cli/mcp is gone. New features touch one surface.
- Backend has zero native deps. `ssh2` + `node-pty` both retired — Dockerfile is lighter; CI stops hitting native-build flakiness.
- Local-daemon UX: zero-click pairing, OS-service lifetime, restart + uninstall from the menu.

**Known limits**: session output during the disconnect window is still dropped (no ring buffer yet — tracked in `DAEMON_EVERYWHERE.md` as a Slice 6 gap). Daemon-process crash still kills its children (Electron crash → local-daemon crash → task dies); rarer than backend deploys, handled by launchd's `KeepAlive=true` auto-restart.

## Session 18 (structured-renderer Slice 4 — daemon/SSH support + PTY deletion)
The big cleanup pass. Structured renderer now covers every env type — local (in-process spawn), daemon (new `stream_spawn` wire op), SSH (ssh2 exec channel with `pty: false`) — and the PTY path is gone. Landed as three commits (4a daemon, 4b SSH, 4c deletion) so each step was revertable on its own.

- **Slice 4a — daemon streaming** (`22a4759`): new `stream_spawn` + `close_stream_input` ops + `session.stderr` event in the daemon wire protocol. `packages/daemon/src/executor.ts` gains a non-PTY `streamSpawn` that `child_process.spawn`s the binary with plain pipes; stdout flows back as `session.data`, stderr as `session.stderr`, exit as `session.close`. `environmentService` grows `spawnStreaming` + `closeStreamInput` that route to local (in-process) or daemon (wire op) based on env type. `agentStructured` refactored to go through env service as the transport — no more direct `child_process.spawn`; start() is now async and takes `environmentId`. Dispatcher drops the local-only gate.

- **Slice 4b — SSH streaming** (`7161994`): `sshService` gains `execStream` / `writeToStream` / `closeStreamInput` / `killStream` / `hasStream`. Uses ssh2's exec channel with `pty: false` so stream-json output isn't wrapped in TTY escapes. Env service forwards `stream:*` events under the same `session:*` names. Dispatcher drops the env-type gate entirely — structured now works on `local`, `daemon`, and `ssh`. Environment routes drop the "local only" guard.

- **Slice 4c — PTY deletion**:
  - **agent.ts** collapsed to a single structured path. Removed: `STATUS_PATTERNS`, `detectStatusFromOutput`, `analyzeOutput` (regex-based PTY output scanning), `handleSessionData` + `handleSessionClose` (PTY-only DB writers for `agents.terminal_output` / `tasks.terminal_output`), `buildFastOwlEnvPrefix` + `shellQuote` (PTY-only shell-quote helpers), the whole PTY dispatcher branch in `startAgent`. `startAgent` is now a thin wrapper over the structured path; no more `startStructuredAgent` split.
  - **environment.ts**: removed `spawnInteractive` + `spawnLocalInteractive` + `localPTYs` map + `node-pty` import. Only `localStreams` + `localProcesses` survive.
  - **ssh.ts**: removed `createPTY` / `writeToPTY` / `closePTY` / `resizePTY` / `PTYSession` / `ptySessions` / `pty:data` + `pty:close` events. Streaming-exec is the only path.
  - **daemon/executor.ts**: removed `spawnInteractive`, `ptySessions`, and the `node-pty` dep.
  - **daemon/wsClient.ts**: dropped the `spawn_interactive` case from dispatch.
  - **shared/daemonProtocol.ts**: removed `SpawnInteractiveRequest` from the request union.
  - **Desktop**: removed `XTerm.tsx`, `@xterm/xterm` + `@xterm/addon-fit` + `@xterm/addon-web-links` deps, `.erb/mocks/xtermMock.js` + matching Jest moduleNameMapper. `TaskTerminal.tsx` always renders `AgentConversation`; the `isStructuredTask` check is gone. `TerminalHistory.tsx` still falls back to a plain `<pre>` for historical `terminal_output` rows that pre-date the structured renderer — those can't be back-filled, so they stay readable as legacy data.
  - **Tests**: deleted `agent.envPrefix.test.ts` + `agent.statusDetection.test.ts` (tested functions that no longer exist). `fakeEnvironment.ts` rewritten to patch `spawnStreaming` + `closeStreamInput` instead of `spawnInteractive`. `gitService` refactored from the PTY-session-event-listener pattern to `environmentService.exec()` (one-shot). Full suite: **94 tests** passing in ~40s.
  - **git.ts**: `executeGitCommand` simplified — dropped the `spawnInteractive` + session-event-listener + 5s timeout dance, now just calls `environmentService.exec()` and returns stdout.
  - **Schema / migration**: `0008_default_structured_renderer.sql` flips the default + back-fills existing rows from `'pty'` to `'structured'`. The column is kept (not dropped) so rollback stays possible — but no code path reads `'pty'` anymore.
  - **Infra**: Dockerfile + `scripts/install-daemon.sh` no longer install `build-essential` / `python3` for node-pty's native build. `ssh2` is the last remaining native dep; its prebuilds cover linux-x64 cleanly.

- **What this buys us**:
  - Single code path for every env type. No more "does this task use PTY or structured?" branches scattered across agent.ts, environment.ts, tasks routes, desktop components.
  - One storage format going forward (`tasks.transcript`). `tasks.terminal_output` is kept read-only for historical rows.
  - Lighter Electron bundle — one fewer native dep (node-pty) + ~3 xterm.js packages gone. Notable on Windows where node-pty was a recurring build-nightmare.
  - Any new agent feature touches one surface (structured) — no parity-between-paths work.

- **Deferred follow-ups**: backend-restart reliability (task #6 — designing keep-alive-across-restarts; not in Slice 4's scope). Optionally dropping `tasks.terminal_output` + `agents.terminal_output` + the `environments.renderer` column once we're confident no rollback is needed.

## Session 18 (structured-renderer Slice 3 — interactive multi-turn + reliability polish)
Interactive structured tasks: user-initiated tasks on a structured local env now run against a long-lived `claude -p --input-format stream-json --output-format stream-json` child. User types, child processes a turn, emits a `result` event, we flip status to `idle`, user can type again. Same strict-permission machinery as Slice 2 still applies — hook fires on every tool, UI shows Approve/Deny inline. Plus a batch of reliability / UX polish:

- **Streaming-input mode** in `agentStructured.ts`: new `interactive: boolean` option on `StructuredRunOptions`. When true, args include `--input-format stream-json`, the seed prompt is wrapped as a stream-json `{type:"user", message:...}` envelope, and stdin stays open. New methods:
  - `sendMessage(sessionKey, text)` — writes a user-message JSONL envelope to the child's stdin. Throws if the run is one-shot or stdin is already closed.
  - `closeInput(sessionKey)` — graceful end of conversation. Child finalises current turn, exits with code 0, task → `awaiting_review`.
  - `stop(sessionKey)` unchanged — hard SIGTERM for aborts.
- **Turn-complete signalling**: new `turn_complete` event emitted on each `result`. `agentService` listens and flips agent status back to `idle` for interactive runs so the desktop re-enables the input box.
- **Dispatcher change** (`agent.ts`): dropped the `autonomous && prompt` gate. A structured local env now drives **all** tasks through the structured path — autonomous ones as one-shot, user-initiated ones as interactive. `sendInput(agentId, text)` routes to `agentStructuredService.sendMessage()` for structured sessions, existing `writeToSession()` for PTY.
- **No more timeout on permission prompts**: removed `DECISION_TIMEOUT_MS` + setTimeout from `permissionService`. Pending requests now wait indefinitely. Rationale: matches the "inbox item sits until you look at it" mental model; backend-restart case was already handled by SIGPIPE-on-closed-pipe killing the child regardless; cheapens a queued prompt to a setImmediate-level wait instead of a live-timer.
- **Inbox coalescer for pending prompts** (`packages/backend/src/services/permissionInbox.ts`, ~140 LOC): subscribes to `permissionService` events at backend init. First pending prompt on a task inserts one `agent_question` inbox item. Subsequent prompts bump a counter + swap the summary in place (no new items). Last pending resolved → `status: 'actioned'` + `actionedAt` stamp. Had to add an `insertReady` promise to the tracked entry so concurrent update requests await the initial INSERT — otherwise UPDATEs could silently hit 0 rows against a not-yet-persisted `id`.
- **Boot-time orphan cleanup** (`agent.ts` `cleanupStaleAgents`): extended to also flip the orphaned tasks themselves from `in_progress` → `failed` with `result.error = 'backend restart orphaned the agent'`. Previously `cleanupStaleAgents` only dropped agent rows; tasks would ghost for up to 20 min until `recoverStuckTasks` caught them. Now the post-deploy ghost window is seconds. (Deeper reliability work — keeping children alive across restarts — is queued as a follow-up; not in scope for Slice 3.)
- **Desktop input bar upgrade** (`TaskTerminal.tsx`): old single-line `<input>` replaced with an auto-growing `<textarea>` (1–8 rows). Enter sends; Shift+Enter inserts a newline. Structured tasks: send disabled while the agent is `working` / `tool_use`; placeholder reflects state ("Claude is working…", "Type your response…", etc.). PTY tasks: behaviour unchanged (always enabled — answering TUI prompts needs immediate writes).
- **Deferred to follow-ups** (not in Slice 3 despite being on the original plan):
  - Session resume across process restarts (needs `--session-id` + dropping `--no-session-persistence`). The `handleStructuredExit` path currently writes `failed` on non-zero exit — resuming would require a different lifecycle.
  - Slash-command palette UI (Cmd+K). Not needed: the child's own parser handles `/clear`, `/model`, `/compact`, etc. when we pass the text through as a user message.
  - `@file` refs, image paste, `!shell`. Parity polish; independent from this plumbing.
- **Tests** (+5 inbox, +3 agentStructured): `permissionInbox.test.ts` covers first-request creates item, coalescing with counter, last-resolved auto-actions, per-task separation. `agentStructured.test.ts` extended with `buildClaudeArgs` assertions for interactive flag + strict-mode + interactive combined. Full suite: **109 tests** passing in ~41s.

- **Files**: `packages/backend/src/services/agentStructured.ts`, `packages/backend/src/services/agent.ts`, `packages/backend/src/services/permissionService.ts`, `packages/backend/src/services/permissionInbox.ts` (new), `packages/backend/src/index.ts`, `packages/backend/src/__tests__/permissionInbox.test.ts` (new), `packages/backend/src/__tests__/permissionService.test.ts`, `packages/backend/src/__tests__/agentStructured.test.ts`, `apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/panels/TaskTerminal.tsx`.

## Session 18 (structured-renderer Slice 2 — AgentConversation + per-tool permission UX)
Builds on Slice 1's plumbing. Strict-mode autonomous tasks now run through a `PreToolUse` hook that blocks the CLI on every tool call until the user clicks Approve / Deny in the desktop. "Allow always" persists onto an env-scoped tool allowlist so repeated approvals stop pestering you. The conversation UI replaces Slice 1's interim event dump with a proper block view.

- **Hook mechanism** (`packages/backend/src/services/permissionHook.ts`): a dependency-free CJS script written to `/tmp/fastowl-hook-<random>/permission.cjs` at first strict-mode run. Reads the PreToolUse JSON on stdin, POSTs to the backend with `x-fastowl-permission-token`, writes the `{hookSpecificOutput:{permissionDecision}}` decision to stdout. Defaults to `deny` on any error — a broken backend never silently grants a tool. Script lives for the backend process lifetime; idempotent writer.

- **Permission service** (`packages/backend/src/services/permissionService.ts`, ~200 LOC): in-process state machine. `registerRun()` mints a per-run token (random 24 bytes, hex) the child needs to present for any permission call; `verifyRunToken` is timing-safe. `requestDecision()` short-circuits to `allow` if the tool is on `environments.tool_allowlist`, else registers a pending entry and emits a `request` event, awaiting `respond()`. 10-minute auto-deny timeout. `unregisterRun()` on agent exit denies any still-pending requests so a killed child never leaves the CLI wedged.

- **Routes** (`packages/backend/src/routes/permission.ts`): `POST /api/v1/permission-hook` (unauth'd by JWT, token-auth'd via header) is what the child hook hits. `POST /api/v1/tasks/:id/permission` (JWT-auth'd) is what the desktop hits when the user clicks a button — ownership checked via `tasks → environments.owner_id`. `GET /api/v1/tasks/:id/permission/pending` replays open prompts for reconnect.

- **Schema**: `0007_env_tool_allowlist.sql` adds `environments.tool_allowlist jsonb default '[]'`. Populated by the "Allow always" button. Scoped per-env (not per-task) — one approval sticks for every future task on that machine.

- **Wire protocol**: two new WS event types, `agent:permission_request` and `agent:permission_response`. We *also* inject synthetic `fastowl_permission_request` / `fastowl_permission_response` / `fastowl_permission_auto_allowed` events into the transcript so the renderer has a single ordered stream; the dedicated WS types are kept for future standalone notification patterns. Force-persist on any fastowl-synthetic event so a reconnect mid-prompt sees the pending card (can't wait for the usual every-25-events sample).

- **Dispatcher change** (`packages/backend/src/services/agent.ts`): structured runs now respect `env.autonomousBypassPermissions` — `true` → `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` (no hook), `false` → `--permission-mode default` with the hook. Bypass for throwaway daemons, strict for everything you care about. Strict mode also sets `FASTOWL_PERMISSION_TOKEN` + `FASTOWL_AGENT_ID` + `FASTOWL_ENVIRONMENT_ID` in the child's env so the hook can authenticate and the backend can scope allowlist lookups.

- **Renderer** (`apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/terminal/AgentConversation.tsx`, ~450 LOC): replaces the interim `StructuredTranscript.tsx` (deleted). Collapses the event stream into a block model (text / thinking / tool_use / tool_result / permission / system / result) and renders each block with its own component. Text blocks get a hand-rolled markdown-ish renderer (newlines preserved, fenced code blocks, inline backticks — no new deps). Tool_use / tool_result / thinking blocks are collapsed by default; click to expand to full JSON / raw output. Permission blocks show the tool name + JSON input + three buttons: **Allow once**, **Allow always (tool)**, **Deny**; auto-collapse into a green/red summary when the corresponding `fastowl_permission_response` event arrives. Footer shows cost / tokens / denial count from the `result` event.

- **Desktop API** (`apps/desktop/src/renderer/lib/api.ts`): new `api.tasks.respondToPermission(taskId, requestId, decision, persist)` + `api.tasks.listPendingPermissions(taskId)`.

- **Tests** (+13): `permissionService.test.ts` covers the full state machine — token mint + verify, pre-approved tool auto-allows without emitting a request event, non-approved tool registers pending + fires `request`, allow+persist writes the allowlist, allow-without-persist doesn't, unknown requestId returns false, 10-minute timeout auto-denies, `unregisterRun` resolves pending as denied, `listPendingForTask` scoping. Uses `vi.useFakeTimers()` for the timeout assertion. Full suite: **115 tests** passing in ~30s.

- **Deliberate scope boundaries for Slice 2**:
  - Still autonomous-only on local envs (same gate as Slice 1). Interactive user-initiated tasks land in Slice 3.
  - Allowlist is exact tool-name match (`Read`, `Bash`). Pattern matching like `Bash(git *)` — which the CLI's own `--allowedTools` supports — comes later if users want it.
  - Daemon / SSH envs still use PTY (they don't have the hook script or a streaming-exec op yet). Structured + these env types is a Slice 4 follow-up.
  - No global "allow any of: Read, Grep, Glob" preset — the user has to approve each distinct tool once, then "Allow always" sticks it.

- **Files**: `packages/shared/src/index.ts` (permission types + new WS event types), `packages/backend/src/db/schema.ts`, `packages/backend/src/db/migrations/0007_env_tool_allowlist.sql` (new), `packages/backend/src/db/migrations/meta/0007_snapshot.json` (new), `packages/backend/src/services/permissionService.ts` (new), `packages/backend/src/services/permissionHook.ts` (new), `packages/backend/src/services/agentStructured.ts`, `packages/backend/src/services/agent.ts`, `packages/backend/src/services/environment.ts`, `packages/backend/src/services/websocket.ts`, `packages/backend/src/routes/permission.ts` (new), `packages/backend/src/routes/environments.ts`, `packages/backend/src/routes/index.ts`, `packages/backend/src/__tests__/permissionService.test.ts` (new), `apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/terminal/AgentConversation.tsx` (new), `apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/terminal/StructuredTranscript.tsx` (deleted), `apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/panels/TaskTerminal.tsx`, `apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/panels/TerminalHistory.tsx`, `apps/desktop/src/renderer/lib/api.ts`.

## Session 18 (structured-renderer Slice 1 — stream-json plumbing)
Start of the move from raw-PTY CLI output to a structured conversation renderer. The original plan was to swap the `claude` CLI for `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`, but research + a spike showed the SDK is API-key-only by policy — Claude Pro/Max subscription auth is explicitly unsupported, so migrating would force every existing user onto metered API billing. Path C instead: keep spawning the `claude` binary (so OAuth subscription auth continues to work) but switch to `--output-format stream-json --verbose --include-partial-messages`, which emits the same structured events the SDK does. All three planned phases (A autonomous-strict, B autonomous-bypass, C interactive) land on this shared foundation.

- **Spike findings** (documented before coding):
  - `claude -p --output-format stream-json --verbose` emits JSONL for `system` / `assistant` / `user` / `stream_event` / `result` — content blocks include `text`, `thinking`, `tool_use`, `tool_result`. Init event shows `apiKeySource: "none"` confirming OAuth creds from `~/.claude/` are honored.
  - `--include-partial-messages` adds `content_block_delta` events (chunky but usable text streaming).
  - `PreToolUse` hooks configured via `--settings '<inline-json>'` synchronously gate tool use — our eventual permission-callback path for Slice 2.
  - Inline `--settings` JSON works, so no temp-file-per-spawn plumbing needed.

- **Shared types** (`packages/shared/src/index.ts`): `Environment.renderer: 'pty' | 'structured'` + new `EnvironmentRenderer`. `Task.transcript?: AgentEvent[]`. `AgentEvent` defined permissively (mirrors the CLI's own schema — `type`, optional `subtype`, `message`, `event`, `result`, etc., plus our own `seq: number` for ordering). Two new WS event types: `agent:event` and `task:event` with `AgentEventBroadcast` / `TaskEventBroadcast` payloads.

- **DB migration** (`0006_structured_renderer.sql`): `environments.renderer` (text, default `'pty'`), `tasks.transcript` (jsonb nullable). Fresh installs default to `'pty'` — no behavioural change for existing envs/tasks.

- **New service** (`packages/backend/src/services/agentStructured.ts`, ~230 LOC):
  - `AgentStructuredService.start(opts)` non-PTY-spawns `claude` with the stream-json argv, writes the prompt on stdin, and parses stdout line by line via `JsonlLineParser`.
  - Each parsed event gets a monotonic `seq` stamp, appended to an in-memory transcript, broadcast as `agent:event` + `task:event`, and persisted to `tasks.transcript` every 25 events (and unconditionally on `type === 'result'`).
  - Transcripts are capped at `TRANSCRIPT_MAX_EVENTS = 2000`: above the cap, the middle drops out with a `{type: 'system', subtype: 'truncated'}` marker. Prevents one unruly autonomous task from nuking the jsonb column.
  - `stop()` kills the child with SIGTERM; the `completion` promise resolves with whatever exit code the child produces.
  - Stderr from the child is surfaced as synthetic `system/stderr` events so the UI can render CLI misbehaviour.

- **Dispatcher** (`packages/backend/src/services/agent.ts`): `startAgent` checks `env.renderer === 'structured' && env.type === 'local' && autonomous && prompt` — if true, calls the new `startStructuredAgent` path; otherwise the existing PTY path. The structured path inserts the same `agents` / `tasks` rows (so inbox, task list, stop endpoint all keep working uniformly), writes `task.metadata.runtime = 'structured'` so the UI can pick the right renderer, and maps exit code onto the existing `awaiting_review` / `failed` rules via a new `handleStructuredExit`. `stopAgent` routes to `agentStructuredService.stop()` for structured sessions and the existing PTY kill for everyone else.

- **Routes** (`packages/backend/src/routes/environments.ts`): `POST /environments` accepts optional `renderer` on create (defaults to `'pty'`, silently falls back to `'pty'` for non-local envs in Slice 1). `PATCH /environments/:id` honors `renderer` updates with the same guard. Both echo `renderer` in responses. `GET /tasks/:id/terminal` now returns `{ terminalOutput, transcript, runtime }` so callers can pick the right renderer.

- **WS helpers** (`packages/backend/src/services/websocket.ts`): `emitAgentEvent` + `emitTaskEvent` broadcast structured events to workspace subscribers.

- **Desktop**:
  - New `apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/terminal/StructuredTranscript.tsx` (interim Slice-1 renderer): one line per event, colour-coded by type, with a one-line summary (text snippet, `→ tool(args)`, `← ok/err`, cost for `result`). Replaced by Slice 2's `AgentConversation.tsx`.
  - `TaskTerminal.tsx` branches on `task.metadata.runtime === 'structured'` — renders `StructuredTranscript` instead of `XTerm`.
  - `TerminalHistory.tsx` rewritten to fetch `{ terminalOutput, transcript, runtime }` and pick the renderer per-task.
  - `useApi.ts` subscribes to `task:event`, dedups by `seq`, maintains a sorted transcript on the task store entry.

- **Tests**: 12 new unit tests in `agentStructured.test.ts` covering the JSONL parser (partial-line buffering, multi-chunk assembly, blank-line handling, malformed-line tolerance) + `buildClaudeArgs` (bypass mode flag, stream-json defaults, session-persistence disabled). Full suite: **101 tests passing** in ~27s. The end-to-end spawn path is easiest to validate by hand with a running backend — no fake-CLI fixture yet.

- **Deliberate scope boundaries for Slice 1**:
  - Only wired for `autonomous && prompt` tasks on `local` envs. Interactive user-initiated tasks + SSH/daemon envs stay on the existing PTY path until Slice 2/3 and a daemon-side follow-up.
  - Bypass-permissions only. Per-tool Approve/Deny UI comes in Slice 2 via a `PreToolUse` hook invoking an in-process FastOwl endpoint.
  - Interim renderer is deliberately ugly — validates plumbing; Slice 2 builds the markdown + collapsible-tool-call conversation UI.
  - No back-migration of historical `terminal_output` — legacy PTY tasks keep rendering via XTerm forever; the runtime field is sticky per task.

- **Files**: `packages/shared/src/index.ts`, `packages/backend/src/db/schema.ts`, `packages/backend/src/db/migrations/0006_structured_renderer.sql` (new), `packages/backend/src/db/migrations/meta/0006_snapshot.json` (new, regenerated journal), `packages/backend/src/services/agentStructured.ts` (new), `packages/backend/src/services/agent.ts`, `packages/backend/src/services/environment.ts`, `packages/backend/src/services/websocket.ts`, `packages/backend/src/routes/environments.ts`, `packages/backend/src/routes/tasks.ts`, `packages/backend/src/__tests__/agentStructured.test.ts` (new), `apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/terminal/StructuredTranscript.tsx` (new), `apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/panels/TaskTerminal.tsx`, `apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/panels/TerminalHistory.tsx`, `apps/desktop/src/renderer/hooks/useApi.ts`, `apps/desktop/src/renderer/lib/api.ts`.

## Session 17 (failure-cascade hardening — scheduler backoff + stuck-task recovery)
Pass over the Continuous Build scheduler + task queue to close the "runs unattended overnight" part of the DoD. Three cascades fixed: deterministic-failure infinite loop, ghost tasks that never recover from a silent agent death, and the markdown-sync-clobbers-running-task case.

- **Failure counter + backoff + auto-block** (`services/continuousBuild.ts` + `services/backlog/service.ts`):
  - New columns on `backlog_items`: `consecutive_failures` (int, default 0) + `last_failure_at` (timestamptz, nullable). Migration `0004_backlog_failure_tracking.sql`.
  - Scheduler's `onTaskStatus` now distinguishes `failed` (counts as a failure, bumps counter + stamps time) from `cancelled` (user-initiated, doesn't count). Completed/approved resets the counter to 0.
  - Backoff schedule: 1m → 5m → 15m → 60m by failure count. `nextActionableItem` filters on `lastFailureAt <= cutoff` and the scheduler re-checks the backoff window for the candidate. A looping broken TODO can't hog the queue anymore.
  - After 5 consecutive failures the item flips to `blocked`. Human has to fix whatever's deterministically wrong, then unblock it in the UI.
- **Periodic stuck-task recovery** (`services/taskQueue.ts`): `recoverStuckTasks` used to run only at `init()`. Now also runs every 2 minutes on a timer, and the query picks up an extra case — tasks whose `updated_at` hasn't moved in 20 minutes (proxy for "agent silently dropped"). Covers daemon disconnects mid-task, hung processes, etc. — previously those required a service restart to clear.
- **Guard claimed items against sync auto-completion** (`services/backlog/service.ts`): when a backlog item disappears from the markdown source, `syncSource` auto-marks it completed — but only if it's **not currently claimed**. Previously a running task could have its item silently marked complete by a concurrent markdown edit, orphaning the task's work.
- **Tests** (+7 total): 5 scheduler tests (failure → counter bump, backoff window, 5th failure blocks, cancelled doesn't count, complete clears counter, sync-with-claim is no-op), 1 taskQueue test (time-based staleness recovery), 1 backlog test (claim survives sync-side-delete). Full suite stays fast — 74+6 = 80 tests in ~11s.

- **Why these three and not others from the failure-path audit**: the audit (via explore subagent) turned up more — orphaned git branches, fire-and-forget promise paths in agent status updates, approval-reject flow — but these three were the direct blockers for "unattended overnight": an infinite loop is catastrophic, a stuck task needs periodic rescue, and a sync-race is a silent data-loss bug. The others are quality-of-life and can land when they land.

- **Schema note**: `BacklogItem` gains two fields in `@fastowl/shared` — `consecutiveFailures: number` + `lastFailureAt?: string`. Renderer components that destructure backlog items keep working (new fields are additive); the UI doesn't render them yet, but they're available for a future "this item has failed N times" badge.

- **Files**: `packages/backend/src/services/continuousBuild.ts`, `packages/backend/src/services/backlog/service.ts`, `packages/backend/src/services/taskQueue.ts`, `packages/backend/src/db/schema.ts`, `packages/backend/src/db/migrations/0004_backlog_failure_tracking.sql` (new), `packages/shared/src/index.ts`, tests across three files.

## Session 17 (test hang fix — daemonRegistry fire-and-forget UPDATE race)
CI (and local `npm test`) had been timing out in `daemonRegistry.test.ts`. Diagnosed as a race between `markEnvConnected` (fired by `register()`) and `markEnvDisconnected` (fired by `unregister()`) — both are fire-and-forget `.update()` calls on the same environment row. Under pglite (the test harness), running two unawaited UPDATEs on the same row concurrently **pins the worker at 100% CPU** inside pglite's WASM scheduler. Bisected down from the whole file → to the fourth test ("disconnecting a daemon rejects its in-flight requests") — the one case that exercises both register+unregister inline — and traced it to a hang at `pglite.waitReady` in the *next* test's `beforeEach` (WASM init starves once the previous test leaves pending in-flight queries behind).

- **Fix**: introduced a private `dbTail: Promise<void>` in `daemonRegistry` that serializes every env-status flip. `markEnvConnected` and `markEnvDisconnected` now `.then()`-append onto `dbTail` so writes happen in order, never concurrently for the same row. Added `flushPending()` and made `shutdown()` `async` + await `flushPending()` so tests cleanly drain before pglite closes.
- **Callers updated**: `packages/backend/src/index.ts` SIGTERM handler + `daemonRegistry.test.ts` afterEach now `await daemonRegistry.shutdown()`.
- **Result**: full backend suite goes from timing out to **74/74 passed in 11.6s**. `daemonRegistry.test.ts` on its own: 5/5 in 4s.
- **Why the race didn't show up on real Postgres**: a real connection supports multiple concurrent statements; pglite serializes through a single WASM instance and the fire-and-forget pattern leaves the worker's microtask queue clogged when the following test tries to spin up a fresh pglite. Production (Supabase) was fine.
- **Files**: `packages/backend/src/services/daemonRegistry.ts`, `packages/backend/src/index.ts`, `packages/backend/src/__tests__/daemonRegistry.test.ts`.

## Session 17 (Phase 18.3.B — SSH auto-install of the daemon)
The "give me SSH creds and I'll do the rest" path. Desktop's Add Environment dialog now has a **Remote VM (FastOwl daemon)** type with two modes: **auto-install over SSH** (backend SSHes in and runs a hosted install script) or **manual** (shows a copy-paste one-liner). Either way, a daemon env is created, a pairing token is minted, and the env flips to `connected` as soon as the daemon dials back — no user JWT ever touches the VM.

- **Shared types**: added `DaemonEnvironmentConfig` (`type: 'daemon'`, `hostname?`, `workingDirectory?`) to the `EnvironmentConfig` union + `InstallDaemonOverSshRequest`/`Response`. Keeps the Environment type honest now that daemon envs are first-class.
- **`scripts/install-daemon.sh`** (new): OS-aware provisioning script served via the backend. Installs Node 22 (NodeSource on Debian/Ubuntu, yum-nodesource on RHEL, `brew` on macOS, nvm fallback), installs `build-essential` + `python3` on Linux for node-pty, clones `Gilbert09/owl`, builds `@fastowl/shared` + `@fastowl/daemon`, runs the daemon once in foreground with `--pairing-token` to exchange for a device token (watches the on-disk config file for `deviceToken` to appear, times out at 60s), then writes a systemd unit at `/etc/systemd/system/fastowl-daemon.service` (Linux) or a launchd plist at `~/Library/LaunchAgents/dev.fastowl.daemon.plist` (darwin). Idempotent — safe to re-run.
- **Backend public route** (`routes/daemon.ts`): `GET /daemon/install.sh` serves the script. Unauthenticated by design — the credential is the pairing token, not the HTTP request. Dockerfile now `COPY scripts ./scripts` so the script is on disk at runtime.
- **Backend SSH installer** (`services/daemonInstaller.ts`): uses ssh2 to dial the target, supports `password` + `privateKey` auth (raw PEM content, not file paths — the private key gets pasted into the desktop UI and is used once per install), exec's `curl -fsSL <backend>/daemon/install.sh | bash -s -- --backend-url ... --pairing-token ...`, captures stdout+stderr, returns the log. 5-minute timeout.
- **Backend route**: `POST /api/v1/environments/:id/install-daemon` — owner-scoped, validates env type is `daemon`, mints a fresh pairing token on every call, resolves the backend URL from `FASTOWL_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` env var (falls back to `req.protocol://req.host`), hands off to `installDaemonOverSsh`. Returns `{ success, log, exitCode, backendUrl }`.
- **Desktop UI** (`AddEnvironmentModal.tsx`): rewritten around three types. "Remote VM (FastOwl daemon)" is the new default for cloud-backend users; "SSH (legacy)" is kept behind a warning for local-backend users. In daemon/ssh-install mode: host/port/user + (password | pasted PEM key + optional passphrase). In daemon/manual mode: after creation, shows the copy-paste one-liner with a Copy button. Either way, after submit, the modal polls `GET /environments/:id` every 3s and flips to "Daemon connected!" when the backend sees the daemon dial back.
- **Docs**: Roadmap 18.3 flipped to `[x]` for remote install; single-file binary is deferred (git-clone install works end-to-end). Priority queue now has 17.3 (notifications) at the top.

- **Design decisions**:
  - **Git clone, not a prebuilt binary** — the MVP install path shells out to `git clone` + `npm install` + `npm run build` rather than shipping a prebuilt tarball. Reasons: `node-pty` is a native module, and cross-compiling a binary that works on linux/amd64 + linux/arm64 + darwin/arm64 adds a whole CI pipeline. The git-clone path uses whatever Node is on the target, builds native modules in place, and avoids a new release surface. Downside: first install on a VM takes ~2 minutes instead of ~10 seconds. Acceptable for now.
  - **Pasted PEM instead of key file** — the hosted backend can't read the user's `~/.ssh/id_rsa`. The install endpoint accepts the private key contents in the request body, uses it for a single ssh2 connection, and never stores it. Memory-only, dies with the request. Same principle as the install-script one-liner: the credential exists in the path of the install and nowhere else.
  - **One pairing token per install call** — every `POST /install-daemon` invocation mints a fresh token (even for the same env). Avoids the "pairing token reuse" failure mode if the previous install timed out or was interrupted. Tokens expire in 10min anyway, so there's no cleanup debt.
  - **Polling instead of WebSocket for "daemon connected"** — the modal polls the env's status every 3s. Could push an `environment:status` WS event (we already emit them), but the modal is short-lived enough that polling is simpler than hooking into the store and filtering.

- **Still to land (deferred)**:
  - Symmetric uninstall flow (delete env → SSH in → systemctl disable + rm). Not critical.
  - Prebuilt daemon binary (`bun --compile`) — avoids the ~2min first-install npm install step. Nice-to-have.
  - Wire-up streaming install logs to the modal via WS (today we only show the log after the install finishes). UX nit.
  - End-to-end test of the install flow against a real VM. Covered manually; no CI yet.

- **Files touched**: `packages/shared/src/index.ts` (DaemonEnvironmentConfig + install API types); `scripts/install-daemon.sh` (new); `packages/backend/src/routes/daemon.ts` (new); `packages/backend/src/routes/index.ts` (mount `/daemon`); `packages/backend/src/services/daemonInstaller.ts` (new); `packages/backend/src/routes/environments.ts` (install-daemon endpoint); `Dockerfile` (COPY scripts); `apps/desktop/src/renderer/lib/api.ts` (pairingToken + installDaemon helpers); `apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/modals/AddEnvironmentModal.tsx` (rewritten).

- **How to exercise it locally**:
  1. `npm run dev -w @fastowl/backend` (local backend on 4747)
  2. Open desktop, Settings → Environments → Add
  3. Pick **Remote VM (FastOwl daemon)** → **Show me the install command** (the SSH path requires a real VM)
  4. Name it, Generate → copy the one-liner
  5. On any VM: paste the command (it'll curl from `http://localhost:4747/daemon/install.sh` which only works from the same network; for a real test, set `FASTOWL_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` to the hosted URL)
  6. Modal flips to "Daemon connected!" when the daemon dials back.

- **Next action**: **Phase 18.2 polish** (proper `fastowl login` PKCE + CLI refresh-token rotation + cross-user HTTP-layer integration test) or **Phase 18.3 polish** (single-file daemon binary via `bun --compile`).

### Phase 17.3 landed in the same session

Desktop OS notification fires when any task transitions into `awaiting_review`. Implementation is surprisingly small — the renderer already subscribes to `task:status` events; added a pre-update status check to detect the transition (to avoid firing on idempotent restates), then `new Notification(...)` in the granted-permission path. Electron bridges the renderer-side `Notification` constructor to the native OS surface — no preload work, no main-process IPC.

- **Preference**: stored in `localStorage` under `fastowl:notify:awaitingReview`. Default on. Toggled from Settings → Appearance → Notifications.
- **Permission**: requested lazily on first-eligible event. Settings toggle also requests eagerly on flip-to-on so the permission prompt doesn't race with the actual event. When the OS-level permission is denied, the settings panel surfaces a "Notifications are blocked at the OS level" hint.
- **Click-through**: `n.onclick = () => window.focus()` brings the app forward. Could later deep-link to the specific task (route + select) but the inbox + queue are both visible on the main screen.
- **Transition semantics**: we grab the previous task from the store BEFORE applying the update, so `wasAwaitingReview` reflects the prior state. If a WS event arrives that re-states `awaiting_review` without a transition (recovery path, duplicate event), no notification fires.
- **Files**: `apps/desktop/src/renderer/hooks/useApi.ts` (new `maybeNotifyAwaitingReview` + pref helpers); `apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/panels/SettingsPanel.tsx` (Notifications card in AppearanceSettings); `docs/ROADMAP.md` + `CLAUDE.md` + this note.
- **Deferred**: per-task-type toggles, digest mode, click-through that deep-links to the task. None block the "production ready" goal.

## Session 16 (Phase 18.3.B foundation — daemon relay layer)
Option-1 relay shipped. Child processes spawned by a daemon (`claude` running a task, `fastowl` CLI calls from within that Claude, any MCP server) now reach the backend through a local HTTP proxy on the daemon, which tunnels each request over the daemon's authenticated WS. No user JWT ever lives on the VM.

- **Protocol**: added `ProxyHttpRequest` / `ProxyHttpResult` to the daemon↔backend wire. Request is { method, path, headers, body (base64) } — full REST round-trip, not a typed RPC surface. Keeps every existing route available to daemon children without duplicating the API.
- **Backend auth refactor**: `requireAuth` now accepts two credential paths. Path 1 (existing): `Authorization: Bearer <Supabase JWT>`. Path 2 (new): `X-Fastowl-Internal-User: <uuid>` + `X-Fastowl-Internal-Token: <secret>`. The secret is minted once at process boot with `randomBytes(48)` and held only in memory — reboot rotates it. Comparison is `timingSafeEqual`. Internal requests resolve the user from the `users` table directly, skipping the Supabase round-trip.
- **Backend proxy dispatcher** (`services/daemonProxyHandler.ts`): when a daemon sends `proxy_http_request` on its WS, backend looks up `env.owner_id`, makes a localhost `fetch` against `http://127.0.0.1:${PORT}${path}` with `internalProxyHeaders(ownerId)`, and ships the response back in a `proxy_http_response`. Drops `authorization`, `cookie`, `host`, and hop-by-hop headers from the inbound side; drops `content-length` / `transfer-encoding` from the outbound response (daemon recomputes).
- **Daemon proxy server** (`proxyServer.ts`): HTTP server bound to `127.0.0.1:0` (random port). Every inbound request is serialized into `proxy_http_request`, sent over the WS, and awaited up to 60s. On daemon start, `FASTOWL_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:<port>` is set as a child-env override; `FASTOWL_AUTH_TOKEN` is always scrubbed from the spawn env so a stale user token can't leak through.
- **Daemon WS client**: now sends daemon→backend `request` messages (previously only events). Tracks its own `pendingProxyRequests` map with 60s timeouts; rejects them all on shutdown.
- **Tests**: `daemonProxy.test.ts` mounts `requireAuth` on a minimal Express app and exercises the internal-header path — valid user, wrong token, unknown user. All four pass; full backend suite is 74/74.

- **Still to land in 18.3.B**:
  - Rewire scheduler / taskQueue so tasks actually execute on `daemon` envs end-to-end (today they still prefer legacy `local`/`ssh`).
  - `fastowl-daemon install` + server-hosted `install.sh` + tarball publication (probably from Railway `/daemon/latest.tar.gz` for MVP).
  - Desktop "Add SSH environment → Install FastOwl daemon" checkbox that SSHes in, runs the install, polls for the daemon to dial back.
  - Ownership propagation: provisioning an env + dispatching a proxy request both hinge on `env.owner_id`; need a regression test that covers user-A-VM cannot proxy as user-B.

- **How to exercise the relay today**:
  1. `npm run dev -w @fastowl/backend`
  2. Create a daemon env + pairing token via REST (auth'd with your CLI token as before).
  3. `node packages/daemon/dist/index.js --pairing-token <x> --backend-url http://localhost:4747`
  4. Daemon logs `listening on http://127.0.0.1:<port>`.
  5. From the shell where the daemon is running: `FASTOWL_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:<port> FASTOWL_AUTH_TOKEN= fastowl workspace list` — request hits the local proxy, tunnels over WS, backend answers as the daemon's owner.

- **Follow-up commits landed same session**:
  - `a0000ea` Daemon envs are first-class in scheduling: daemonRegistry updates `environments.status` on register/unregister; `backlogService` and `continuousBuildScheduler` fall back to any connected daemon when no env is pinned; `connectSavedEnvironments` on startup marks daemon envs disconnected until they dial back.
  - `9e82bc7` CI hygiene: `@fastowl/daemon` gets `--passWithNoTests` so an empty suite doesn't fail CI; `taskQueueService` gains a `shuttingDown` flag + `runProcessQueue` wrapper that swallows the "DATABASE_URL is not set" noise triggered by floating promises after a test's DB reset; AuthProvider no longer `console.error`s when Supabase env vars are missing (LoginScreen already surfaces a visible warning).

## Session 15 (Phase 18.3.A — daemon package + WS transport)
Foundation for the SSH auto-install flow. Daemon package exists and can dial the hosted backend; backend has a `/daemon-ws` endpoint, a registry that tracks live daemons, and a `daemon` env type that proxies commands through. No UX change yet — Phase 18.3.B bolts the "Install daemon" checkbox onto the Add-SSH-env dialog.

- **Wire protocol** in `@fastowl/shared/daemonProtocol.ts`: JSON-framed WS envelopes with `hello` / `hello_ack` / `request` / `response` / `event`. Correlation IDs on request/response. Close codes in the 4xxx range for a daemon to log a clear reason (4401 unauthorized, 4409 duplicate, 4500 server shutdown). Encoded as `JSON.stringify(envelope)` so the same types also work over stdio if we ever need a local test daemon.
- **`packages/daemon`** (new workspace): `executor.ts` wraps `child_process.spawn` + `node-pty`, `git.ts` mirrors backend `gitService` via exec, `wsClient.ts` handles the dial/hello/reconnect loop (exponential backoff capped at 30 s), `config.ts` resolves CLI args / env vars / `~/.fastowl/daemon.json` with that precedence. Bin is `fastowl-daemon`.
- **Schema**: `environments` gets `device_token_hash` (SHA-256 of the long-lived daemon token) and `last_seen_at`, plus a new env type `daemon`. Migration 0003. `0002_snapshot.json` got re-ided because Stage 5's manual copy had a duplicate id that collided with drizzle-kit on regen.
- **Backend**:
  - `services/daemonRegistry.ts` owns pairings (in-memory, 10 min TTL) and live daemon connections. Mints device tokens, matches them on reconnect, issues requests with 30 s timeouts, routes responses by correlation id, forwards events as `session.data` / `session.close` / `status` EventEmitter events. No background timers — pairing expiry is swept inline on each `authenticate` call so tests don't have to deal with open timer handles.
  - `services/daemonWs.ts` accepts connections at `/daemon-ws`, enforces a 5-second hello timeout, hands auth off to the registry, then routes subsequent messages.
  - `services/environment.ts` gained `case 'daemon':` branches for `connect`, `exec`, `spawnInteractive`, `writeToSession`, `killSession`, `getStatus`. Sub-daemon events flow back through the existing `session:data` / `session:close` EventEmitter the rest of the backend already listens for.
  - `index.ts`: separate `WebSocketServer({ noServer: true })` for daemon upgrades, path-dispatched on the HTTP `upgrade` event so the existing `/ws` keeps its own handler.
  - `routes/environments.ts`: new `POST /:id/pairing-token` mints a one-shot pairing token for a daemon env. Validates ownership + env type. 10-minute TTL.
- **Tests**: `daemonRegistry.test.ts` covers pairing-then-device handshake, reconnect-with-device-token, request/response round-trip, in-flight rejection on disconnect, and event forwarding. Uses a `FakeWs` EventEmitter stand-in so no sockets or network. 70/70 green.

- **Deliberately deferred to follow-ups**:
  - Bundled daemon spawn from Electron main — the user has to run the daemon manually (CLI) for now. Next: desktop spawns daemon as a child process on app start, creates a local daemon env, pairs automatically.
  - Liveness heartbeat (periodic `last_seen_at` stamp while connected) — today it's set on register only.
  - UI to create a daemon env + show the `fastowl-daemon --pairing-token X --backend-url Y` command.
  - Legacy `local` / `ssh` env types still exist and still work when the backend runs on the user's laptop; only the `daemon` type works against the hosted backend.

- **How to try it locally** (dev loop):
  1. Point desktop at local backend: `FASTOWL_API_URL=http://localhost:4747` in `apps/desktop/.env`, rebuild.
  2. Start the backend (`npm run dev -w @fastowl/backend`).
  3. Create a daemon env via API: `POST /api/v1/environments` with `{ "type": "daemon", "name": "My Mac", "config": {} }` (requires bearer token from desktop login → Copy CLI token).
  4. Mint a pairing token: `POST /api/v1/environments/:id/pairing-token`.
  5. Run the daemon: `node packages/daemon/dist/index.js --pairing-token <token> --backend-url http://localhost:4747`.
  6. Watch it pair, write `~/.fastowl/daemon.json`, stay connected. Restart with no args and it reconnects using the stored device token.

- **Next action (Phase 18.3.B)**: "Add SSH environment → Install FastOwl daemon" checkbox in the desktop dialog. Backend SSHes in, runs a server-hosted `install.sh`, writes a systemd/launchd unit, starts the service. At that point: one click to onboard a VM.

## Session 14 (Phase 18.4 — backend on Railway)
Backend now live at `https://fastowl-backend-production.up.railway.app`. Health check passes, migrations ran on startup, RLS confirmed on every user-scoped table. Desktop `.env` flipped to point at Railway.

- **Dockerfile** (multi-stage): builder installs the whole workspace + compiles with tsc + prunes to prod deps; runtime copies `node_modules` + `dist/` + migrations. Copying node_modules instead of reinstalling keeps `node-pty` / `ssh2` native bindings intact without needing build tools in the runtime image. `.dockerignore` keeps the build context tight (no desktop release, no .env, no docs).
- **Migrations fix**: `tsc` doesn't copy `.sql` files, so the migrate-on-startup would have crashed in prod. Added `build:copy-migrations` postbuild script (`fs.cpSync` — ESM-safe, no shell) that mirrors `src/db/migrations` → `dist/db/migrations`.
- **railway.toml**: DOCKERFILE builder, healthcheck at `/health` (30s window), restart on failure max 5 retries.
- **CI**: `.github/workflows/deploy-backend.yml` deploys on pushes to main that touch backend/shared/Dockerfile, using `RAILWAY_TOKEN` secret. Path-filtered so desktop-only changes don't redeploy.
- **Two gotchas that bit**:
  1. Railway doesn't route IPv6; Supabase's direct `db.<ref>.supabase.co` resolves IPv6. Fix: use the transaction pooler (`aws-1-eu-west-2.pooler.supabase.com:6543`). Session 12 had the wrong region prefix (`aws-0-` vs `aws-1-` — it's project-specific, copy from the dashboard).
  2. `--ignore-scripts` on `npm ci` in the runtime stage strips node-pty's native binary. Moved the install to the builder stage and copied the resulting `node_modules` across — works without shipping python/build-essential to the runtime image.
- **Env vars on Railway** (service `fastowl-backend`): `DATABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `FASTOWL_ALLOWED_EMAILS=owerstom@googlemail.com`, `NODE_ENV=production`. `PORT` auto-provided by Railway.
- **Desktop**: `apps/desktop/.env` gains `FASTOWL_API_URL=https://fastowl-backend-production.up.railway.app`. Commented fallback to `http://localhost:4747` for running against a local backend.
- **Verified**: `GET /health` returns the full service payload; `GET /api/v1/workspaces` without auth returns 401 (middleware enforcing); Supabase query confirms RLS is on for all 10 user-scoped tables, off for `settings`.

- **Still outstanding**:
  - Add `RAILWAY_TOKEN` to GitHub repo secrets (manual; required before the deploy workflow actually runs).
  - Update workspace-integration GitHub OAuth app callback URL if/when we exercise it against the hosted backend.
  - Extra Railway "FastOwl" service auto-created alongside `fastowl-backend` can be deleted via the dashboard — harmless but cluttered.

- **Next action**: **Phase 18.3 — daemon split + SSH auto-install.** With the backend hosted, a VM now has a target to dial out to. Extract env/agent/git services into `packages/daemon`, flip the connection direction, add the "Install FastOwl daemon" checkbox in the Add-SSH-env dialog.

## Session 13 (Phase 18.2 — end-to-end auth)
Wired Supabase GitHub OAuth through backend, desktop, CLI, and MCP in five focused commits. Every REST endpoint and the WebSocket upgrade now require a valid Supabase JWT; data is scoped by `owner_id` at the app layer with RLS as defense in depth.

- **Schema + routes** (`b267d0f`): added `users` table mirroring `auth.users`, added `owner_id` (NOT NULL, FK) on `workspaces` + `environments` — everything else inherits access through its workspace FK. `requireAuth` middleware verifies Supabase JWTs via `auth.getUser(token)`, upserts the user row on first sight, and enforces `FASTOWL_ALLOWED_EMAILS` if set. Every route got ownership gates (helper: `requireWorkspaceAccess`, `requireTaskAccess`, etc.). `/api/v1/github/callback` stays public — state-token lookup guards it. WebSocket accepts `?token=` on upgrade, verifies, then scopes subscribe requests to the connected user's workspaces.
- **Desktop login** (`3790764`): `AuthProvider` wraps the app. Sign-in opens GitHub OAuth in the system browser via `shell.openExternal`, Supabase redirects to `fastowl://auth-callback#access_token=...`, the main process catches the deep link and forwards over IPC. `api.ts` attaches `Authorization: Bearer` to every REST call and the WS upgrade query. Added `fastowl://` to the `protocols` field in `package.json` for packaged builds.
- **CLI + MCP** (`4591c7a`): CLI reads token from `~/.fastowl/token` (mode 0600) or `FASTOWL_AUTH_TOKEN`; new `fastowl token set|show|clear|whoami` commands. MCP is env-only (parent agent sets `FASTOWL_AUTH_TOKEN` on spawn). Desktop Settings gains an Account tab with sign-out and a one-click "Copy CLI token" button — tokens expire hourly so users re-copy as needed. Proper PKCE `fastowl login` deferred.
- **RLS** (`4a9cdd6`): migration enables RLS on all user-scoped tables + policies on `auth.uid()`. Test helper stubs `auth.uid()` so pglite can apply the migration; pglite's superuser connection bypasses RLS the same way the service role does in prod.
- **Docs**: this session note + SETUP.md (Supabase redirect URL, allow-list env var, desktop/CLI env conventions).

- **Key decisions** (ratified with Tom):
  - Ownership lives only on top-level tables (`workspaces`, `environments`) + `users`. Child tables (tasks, agents, inbox, repos, integrations, backlog_sources, backlog_items) cascade access through the workspace FK. Simpler schema, simpler RLS, matches existing mental model.
  - Backend uses the service-role key + app-level owner filtering. Keeps Drizzle usage unchanged; no per-request Supabase client.
  - Electron OAuth = system browser + `fastowl://` deep link. Rejected embedded BrowserWindow (less secure, non-standard).
  - Allow-list env var for single-user mode; invite flow explicitly deferred (documented as TODO in ROADMAP 12.7).

- **Still on the list**:
  - Proper `fastowl login` with PKCE code flow + local callback server (replaces copy-paste token UX).
  - Refresh-token rotation in CLI (right now CLI tokens expire in an hour, user re-copies).
  - Cross-user integration test at the HTTP layer (today's coverage is: migration applies RLS, app-level helpers are structured around owner checks, but we don't spin up two users and assert user A's routes 404 on user B's resources).
  - Invite flow + `workspaces_users` join table once FastOwl needs real multi-tenancy.

- **Files touched**: schema + 2 new migrations; new `middleware/auth.ts` + `services/supabase.ts`; all 8 route files gated; new `renderer/components/auth/{AuthProvider,LoginScreen}.tsx` + `renderer/lib/supabase.ts`; `main/main.ts` + `preload.ts` for deep-link plumbing; CLI `commands/token.ts` + `config.ts`; MCP `client.ts`; Settings panel Account section.

- **Next action**: continue Phase 18.3 (daemon split + auto-install over SSH) or 17.3 (notifications). Auth is done enough to build on top of.

## Session 12 (Hosted backend — Phase A + B landed, Phase C ready to resume)
Started the hosted-backend work from `docs/CONTINUOUS_BUILD_ROADMAP.md`. Phases A + B complete end-to-end on hosted infra. Phase C started then paused to avoid a half-broken main; picks up next session from a known-green state.

- **Phase A (COMPLETED)** — Drizzle ORM scaffolding:
  - `packages/backend/src/db/schema.ts` — Drizzle schema with all 10 tables (workspaces, repositories, integrations, environments, tasks, agents, inboxItems, settings, backlogSources, backlogItems). Upgraded types for Postgres: `jsonb` for structured payloads (settings, config, metadata, result, actions, source, data), `timestamp with time zone` for dates, `boolean` for flags (no more 0/1 ints).
  - `packages/backend/src/db/client.ts` — wraps postgres-js + drizzle-orm, exposes `getDbClient()` singleton + `setDbClient()`/`resetDbClient()` test hooks. Exports `Database` type alias (the Drizzle query builder) that services will consume in Phase C.
  - `packages/backend/drizzle.config.ts` — points schema → `src/db/migrations/`, dialect postgresql, casing snake_case.
  - `packages/backend/src/db/migrations/0000_initial.sql` — generated by `npx drizzle-kit generate --name initial`. 152 lines. This is the target state of the hosted DB; hand-rolled SQLite migrations 001-007 are being retired.
  - Scripts on backend `package.json`: `db:generate`, `db:migrate`, `db:studio`.
  - Deps added: `drizzle-orm@^0.45.2`, `postgres@^3.4.9`, `drizzle-kit@^0.31.10` (dev), `@electric-sql/pglite@^0.4.4` (dev, intended for Phase C tests).
  - `skipLibCheck: true` on `packages/backend/tsconfig.json` (drizzle-orm/sqlite-core ships types that trip strict checks — harmless since we don't use that module).

- **Phase B (COMPLETED)** — Supabase project provisioned via MCP:
  - Organization: `nmgucldojryyubpdxdfg` ("FastOwl")
  - Project: **`fastowl-prod`** — id `xodyzfwlwvgzezwlkrqn`, region `eu-west-2`, status `ACTIVE_HEALTHY`, cost $0/mo
  - Project URL: `https://xodyzfwlwvgzezwlkrqn.supabase.co`
  - All 10 tables live with 0 rows. **RLS is intentionally off** — Phase E turns it on when auth lands.
  - Publishable API keys:
    - anon (legacy JWT) — `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...` (truncated here; full token in Supabase dashboard + MCP)
    - default publishable — `sb_publishable_g6uFDJjjiMG9DNDB9wt_Rg_KsB2nutR`
  - Postgres connection string lives in `packages/backend/.env` as `DATABASE_URL` (format: `postgresql://postgres.xodyzfwlwvgzezwlkrqn:[password]@aws-0-eu-west-2.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres`). `.env` is gitignored.

- **Phase C (STARTED, REVERTED, RESUMES NEXT SESSION)** — services rewrite to Drizzle:
  - **Scope discovered**: 128 `db.prepare(...)` call sites across 13 files (routes/workspaces, routes/environments, routes/tasks, routes/agents, routes/inbox, routes/repositories, routes/github, services/environment, services/agent, services/taskQueue, services/github, services/prMonitor, services/backlog/service, services/continuousBuild, plus src/index.ts). Plus ~20 raw-SQL call sites across the test suite (`packages/backend/src/__tests__/`) that seed fixtures.
  - **Attempted this session**: rewrote `db/index.ts` to Drizzle + converted `routes/workspaces.ts` + `routes/environments.ts` as a proof-of-concept pattern.
  - **Why reverted**: mid-rewrite, main won't typecheck — `DB` type and `db.prepare` calls are incompatible between SQLite (remaining 11 files) and Postgres (the 3 rewritten). No clean incremental path because data lives in one DB (flag-day cutover, not strangler-patternable).
  - **Path for next session**:
    1. Resume by re-doing the conversion for `routes/workspaces.ts`, `routes/environments.ts`, and `db/index.ts`. The pattern is: import `Database` from `db/client.ts`; swap `db.prepare('SELECT ...').all()` for `db.select().from(table).where(...)`; swap `db.prepare('INSERT ...').run(...)` for `db.insert(table).values({...}).returning()`; `rowToXxx` helpers shrink since postgres-js auto-parses jsonb and returns Date objects.
    2. Then bulk-convert in this order: `routes/repositories` → `routes/integrations` (if exists) → `routes/tasks` (biggest, ~550 lines) → `routes/agents` → `routes/inbox` → `routes/github` → `routes/backlog` (mostly already delegates to services, small changes).
    3. Then services in dep order: `services/backlog/service` → `services/continuousBuild` → `services/github` → `services/prMonitor` → `services/agent` → `services/environment` (minimal DB) → `services/taskQueue` (biggest).
    4. Update `src/index.ts` — `initDatabase()` now returns the Drizzle client; `connectSavedEnvironments` needs the new query shape.
    5. Rewrite test suite: `__tests__/helpers/fakeEnvironment.ts` + every `describe` block that seeds via `db.prepare(...)`. Use pglite (`@electric-sql/pglite` already installed) for in-process Postgres. Expected test helper: `await createTestDb()` returns a Drizzle client over pglite with the migration applied; tests inject via `setDbClient()`.
    6. Drop `better-sqlite3` + `@types/better-sqlite3` from backend `package.json` + remove SQLite code from `db/index.ts` (the `getMigrations()` + `runMigrations()` functions — their logic is now encoded in the Drizzle schema).
    7. Final checks: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm test --workspaces --if-present`, run `npm run dev:backend` locally against Supabase to hit the health endpoint.
  - **Estimated effort**: 3-4 hours of focused editing + 1-2 hours for tests. Single session, single atomic commit (no partial commits — keeps main green until it's done).
  - **Don't forget**: `jsonb` columns come back as parsed objects (not JSON strings) → remove `JSON.parse(row.field)`. Booleans come back as `true`/`false` (not `1`/`0`) → remove `=== 1` checks. Dates come back as `Date` instances (not ISO strings) → call `.toISOString()` when serializing to API responses.

- **Docs** landed/updated this session:
  - `docs/CONTINUOUS_BUILD_ROADMAP.md` already has Phase 18.1 + 18.4 (hosted backend) as #1 active — no doc change needed, just execution.
  - This session note.

- **Next action**: start fresh session. Re-read this note. Go through Phase C step-by-step per the plan above.

## Session 11 (Option 3 + fixes + hosting roadmap)
Shipped the "deterministic completion" path for Continuous Build tasks plus four targeted fixes, wrote the production roadmap, and stood up a one-command VM bootstrap script.

- **Option 3 (non-interactive autonomous mode)** (`packages/backend/src/services/agent.ts`):
  - New private `isAutonomousTask(taskId)` — looks up the task row, parses `metadata.backlogItemId`. True when the task was spawned by Continuous Build.
  - `startAgent` branches on this: autonomous tasks spawn `claude --print --permission-mode acceptEdits <quoted-prompt>` via the existing `bash -c` path in `environment.ts` (which already detected `claude --print` and runs accordingly). Process exit now = task done; `handleSessionClose(code=0)` transitions to `awaiting_review`; `code !== 0` transitions to `failed`. No prompt trickery, no hook, no polling.
  - Interactive (user-launched / pr_response / pr_review / manual) tasks unchanged — still PTY-based with prompt written via `writeToSession` after 500ms.
  - Prompt in `continuousBuild.ts:buildPrompt` rewritten: tells Claude to stop responding when done (exit is the signal); removed the "hit Ready for Review" instruction that was meant for humans.

- **Fix: SSH pty exit code** (`packages/backend/src/services/ssh.ts:189`, `agent.ts:178`):
  - ssh2's `stream.on('close', (code, signal) => ...)` does surface an exit code; we were ignoring it and always emitting 0. Now `pty:close` carries the real exit code (or 0 if ssh2 reports null for a normal close). Agent listener forwards it to `handleSessionClose`.

- **Fix: scheduler env-connectivity gate** (`continuousBuild.ts`):
  - New `isSourceEnvironmentReady(source)` — for SSH envs, skips sources whose env isn't `connected`. For local, always ready. Scheduler iterates sources, skips unconnected, tries next. Test covers the disconnect → connect → fire sequence.

- **`scripts/bootstrap-vm.sh`** (new):
  - Idempotent shell script, runnable over SSH (`ssh <host> bash -s -- [opts] < scripts/bootstrap-vm.sh`). Installs Node via nvm if < 18, npm-installs `@anthropic-ai/claude-code`, clones the FastOwl repo, builds shared + cli + mcp-server, npm-links the `fastowl` binary, writes `FASTOWL_API_URL` into `~/.bashrc` (in a managed block that round-trips safely on re-run). Flags: `--api-url`, `--branch`, `--install-dir`, `--skip-node`, `--skip-claude`, `--dry-run`, `--help`. This is the design target for the automated "Add SSH env → install daemon" flow that lands with Phase 18.3; until then you run it manually.

- **Docs**:
  - `docs/CONTINUOUS_BUILD_ROADMAP.md` — the top-of-queue plan. Three ordered phases: hosted backend (18.1+18.4), daemon split + SSH auto-install (18.3), Agent SDK migration (optional, later). Definition of done for "production ready" is explicit.
  - `docs/SSH_VM_SETUP.md` — fast path now front-loaded at the top pointing at the bootstrap script. Manual option kept below as fallback.

- **Tests**: 64 backend → 66 backend (2 new scheduler tests: env-disconnected skip, metadata.backlogItemId written on spawn). 66 + 7 MCP + 3 CLI + 1 desktop = 77 total.

- **Project doc updates**:
  - Priority queue re-ordered: hosted backend now #1 (active), daemon/auto-install #2, notifications #3. Continuous Build bulk-work moved to "done above." Everything else pushed to "later."
  - This session note.

Deferred: Layer-5 idle-timeout safeguard (nice-to-have — Option 3 means most timeouts are moot for autonomous tasks, only matters for interactive). Agent SDK migration (Phase 18 follow-up).

## Session 10 (Continuous Build — Phase 20)
Shipped the whole "point FastOwl at a TODO doc and it builds it" feature end-to-end, covering 20.1–20.5.

- **Backlog model** (`packages/backend/src/services/backlog/`):
  - `parser.ts` — GitHub-flavored markdown checklist parser with section scoping (`#/##/###`), indentation-based nesting, `(blocked)` / `[blocked]` detection, stable SHA1-based external IDs.
  - `service.ts` — DB helpers + `syncSource(id)` which reads the file via `environmentService.exec` and upserts items in a transaction, retiring vanished items rather than deleting (preserves claimed-task linkage).
  - Migrations 006 (`backlog_sources` + `backlog_items`) and 007 (`repository_id` on sources).
  - REST at `/api/v1/backlog/*` (sources CRUD + sync, items list, schedule trigger).

- **Scheduler** (`packages/backend/src/services/continuousBuild.ts`):
  - New in-process domain bus at `packages/backend/src/services/events.ts`. `emitTaskStatus` now fires on both websocket AND domainEvents.
  - Subscribes to `task:status`: on `completed` marks the claimed backlog item complete; on `failed/cancelled` releases the claim; on `awaiting_review` or any terminal status, re-evaluates `scheduleNext`.
  - `scheduleNext` respects workspace `continuousBuild.enabled/maxConcurrent/requireApproval`. Transactionally inserts a `code_writing` task row (status `queued`), claims the item, emits `task:status`.
  - Periodic 60s tick as safety net for missed events.

- **UI** (`apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/panels/SettingsPanel.tsx`):
  - New "Continuous Build" nav section. Toggle + `maxConcurrent` select + require-approval switch.
  - Source manager: add markdown_file source (path + section + environment), sync button per source, delete button.
  - Items preview with status chips.
  - "Run scheduler" button kicks `POST /backlog/schedule` for the current workspace.

- **`@fastowl/cli`** (new workspace `packages/cli`):
  - `fastowl task create|list|ready` + `fastowl backlog sources|sync|items|schedule` + `fastowl ping`.
  - Thin fetch client (`src/client.ts`) using native fetch, unwraps `ApiResponse<T>`, throws typed `ApiError` on failure.
  - Commander-based command setup. Env-aware defaults read `FASTOWL_API_URL`, `FASTOWL_WORKSPACE_ID`, `FASTOWL_TASK_ID`.
  - README at `packages/cli/README.md`, 3 client tests, wired into root `typecheck`.

- **Agent env injection**:
  - `agent.ts` now builds an inline `KEY=val KEY=val claude` prefix via new exported `buildFastOwlEnvPrefix(workspaceId, taskId, { includeApiUrl })`.
  - For **local** envs, `FASTOWL_API_URL=http://localhost:${PORT}` is included. For **SSH** envs it's omitted — the remote shell supplies it via `.bashrc` (see SSH setup doc).
  - Workspace/task IDs are always included so `fastowl task create` works without flags in the child session.

- **Docs**:
  - `docs/SSH_VM_SETUP.md` — full end-to-end: install Claude CLI + fastowl on the VM, three networking options (SSH reverse tunnel / LAN bind / backend on VM), wire up the SSH env in the desktop app, first task, turn on Continuous Build. Troubleshooting section covers the common cases (`claude: command not found`, `ECONNREFUSED` on child CLI calls, SSH drop).
  - `docs/CONTINUOUS_BUILD.md` — feature-level walkthrough: mental model, backlog file format, task-spawns-task via CLI, "turn it on for FastOwl itself" recipe, known limitations.

- **Tests**: 59 backend → 64 backend + 3 CLI = 67 total Vitest + 1 Jest smoke.
  - Parser: 9 tests (flat, nesting, section scoping, stop-at-heading, blocked detection, stable IDs, blank-skip, case-insensitive heading).
  - Service: 9 tests (round-trip, update, delete, syncSource add/retire/claim-preserved, nextActionableItem, skip-claimed, null-when-empty).
  - Scheduler: 8 tests (disabled no-op, spawn-on-empty, maxConcurrent cap, approval hold, approval-off proceed, task-completed → item-completed, task-failed → item-released, disabled-source skip).
  - Env prefix: 5 tests (API-URL default/override, task id optional, single-quote escape, SSH exclusion).
  - CLI: 3 tests (unwrap success, throw on error, POST body).
  - Extended `fakeEnvironment` helper to stub `exec` in addition to `spawnInteractive` so the backlog service's file-read path is testable without a real shell.

Deferred for 20.6: FastOwl MCP server. Deferred for 20.7: GitHub/Linear sources, priority inference, cross-source scheduling, structured `depends-on` annotations.

## Session 9 (Approval Gates — Phase 16.2 + 16.5)
- **Backend agent close** (`packages/backend/src/services/agent.ts`):
  - Clean exit (code 0) now sets task to `awaiting_review` instead of `completed` (no `completed_at`)
  - Non-zero exit still sets task to `failed`
  - Emits `task:status` WS event for the transition
- **New routes** (`packages/backend/src/routes/tasks.ts`):
  - `POST /tasks/:id/ready-for-review` — stops agent, moves task to awaiting_review (agent tasks only)
  - `POST /tasks/:id/approve` — awaiting_review → completed
  - `POST /tasks/:id/reject` — awaiting_review → queued for another pass
- **Frontend API + hooks** (`apps/desktop/src/renderer/lib/api.ts`, `apps/desktop/src/renderer/hooks/useApi.ts`):
  - `api.tasks.readyForReview/approve/reject` client methods
  - `readyForReview/approveTask/rejectTask` in `useTaskActions`
- **UI**:
  - `TaskTerminal` now has a primary "Ready for Review" button alongside "Stop" (stop = discard; ready = approval flow)
  - `QueuePanel` TaskDetail shows "Approve" and "Reject & Requeue" buttons when `task.status === 'awaiting_review'`

**Deferred**: git diff preview in the approval view, approval comments, push-after-approve automation, automated PR response triggering (16.3), PR review batch-post flow (16.4).

## Session 8 (Task Type System — Phase 16.1)
- **Shared types** (`packages/shared/src/index.ts`):
  - `TaskType` expanded to `'code_writing' | 'pr_response' | 'pr_review' | 'manual'`
  - Added `AGENT_TASK_TYPES` constant and `isAgentTask(type)` helper
- **Migration 005** (`packages/backend/src/db/index.ts`):
  - `UPDATE tasks SET type = 'code_writing' WHERE type = 'automated'`
- **Task queue + routes** (`packages/backend/src/services/taskQueue.ts`, `packages/backend/src/routes/tasks.ts`):
  - Auto-processing check switched from `type === 'automated'` to `isAgentTask(type)` (any non-manual)
  - `/tasks/:id/start` now accepts any agent task type
- **CreateTaskModal**:
  - 4-button type picker (Code / PR Response / PR Review / Manual) with icons
  - Type-specific prompt placeholder and description
  - Switches between prompt-first (agent) and title-first (manual) layouts via `isAgentTask`
- **QueuePanel**:
  - `taskTypeConfig` renders type-specific icon + label in task list items and detail view
  - Replaced `isAutomated` check with `isAgentTask(task.type)` for "Start Now" button gating

**Deferred for 16.2-16.5**: approval gates (awaiting_review status), diff preview, automated PR Response triggering, PR Review batch-post flow, type-specific default prompt templates.

## Session 7 (Task Terminal History Persistence)
- **Migration 004** (`packages/backend/src/db/index.ts`):
  - Added `terminal_output TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT ''` column to `tasks` table
- **Append-only task output** (`packages/backend/src/services/agent.ts`):
  - `handleSessionData` now appends incoming chunks to `tasks.terminal_output` via `SET terminal_output = terminal_output || ?`
  - Write cost proportional to each chunk rather than the full buffer
  - Agent record is still truncated to last 10k chars; task output grows for full history
  - Session close preserves the task's output (only deletes the stale agents row)
- **Tasks route** (`packages/backend/src/routes/tasks.ts`):
  - `rowToTask` now takes optional `{ includeTerminalOutput }` flag — only the single-task GET pulls the full output to keep list responses small
  - `/tasks/:id/terminal` falls back to `tasks.terminal_output` when no active agent, so completed/failed/cancelled tasks still return history
- **TerminalHistory component** (`apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/panels/TerminalHistory.tsx`):
  - Fetches task terminal output on mount via `api.tasks.getTerminal`
  - Renders in read-only XTerm with collapse/expand toggle and char count
  - Wired into QueuePanel TaskDetail for `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled` statuses

**Deferred for Phase 15.2/15.4**: structured ndJson conversation log, session resume via Claude CLI, collapsible tool-use sections, history search.
