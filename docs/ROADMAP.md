# Talyn Roadmap

Active priorities live in [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md); the active build-out plan is [`CLOUD_PROVIDERS.md`](./CLOUD_PROVIDERS.md).

> **Cloud-only refactor (June 2026)**: Talyn is now a GitHub PR-management app that delegates work to cloud coding agents. The bundled daemon, local/remote environments, in-process agents, permission gates, and continuous build are gone. The phased history below (Phases 1–20) describes the app that was — kept for the record, **not a TODO list**. Current work is tracked in the Priority Queue / Backlog / Known Gaps sections only.

> **Instructions**: Update this list as work progresses. Mark items completed with `[x]`. Add new items as discovered.

## Priority Queue (Next Up)

1. **Cloud provider abstraction — Phases 0 + 3–5** (see `CLOUD_PROVIDERS.md`)
   - Phase 0 spikes: Codex Cloud (is there a cloud-task REST API, or is it GitHub-mention only?) and Claude Routines (ad-hoc runs vs pre-created routines, transcript retrieval). Cheap (~0.5–1 day each) and they gate everything else.
   - Phases 3–4: the actual `codex/` and `claudeRoutine/` provider modules (client + credentials + converter + transcriptSource + provider each).
   - The deferred `TranscriptSource`/`TranscriptConverter` generalisation — the PostHog streamer/poller are wrapped as-is today, so the first new provider pays that refactor cost.
   - Phase 5: per-provider Settings cards, feature flags, docs.
2. **Desktop generalisation** — Settings integration card + composer model/reasoning controls are hard-coded to PostHog Code; generalise per-provider once a second provider lands (on the Phase 3 critical path).
3. **Multi-instance safety (advisory locks)** — see Known Gaps below; required before running more than one backend replica again.
4. **Auth polish (Phase 18.2 leftovers)** — proper `talyn login` PKCE flow, CLI refresh-token rotation, and the invite flow (`workspaces_users` join table + invitation tokens). Without invites it isn't really multi-tenant, just `TALYN_ALLOWED_EMAILS`.
5. **Desktop test coverage** — `QUALITY_PARITY.md` Tier 1: ~3 trivial renderer test files vs 240+ backend tests; UI regressions go uncaught.

## Backlog

- [ ] **Analytics panel — token / cost usage** — surface an Analytics tab aggregating per-workspace spend, per-task spend + token breakdown, per-model mix, and a trend chart from whatever usage data each cloud provider's transcript/run exposes. Inspiration: how PostHog / Linear surface "insights" around usage.
- [ ] **Show logged-in user in the app chrome** — bottom-left of the sidebar should display GitHub username + avatar so users know which account they're using (especially on laptops with multiple GitHub accounts).
- [ ] **Auto-connect GitHub integration from the Supabase login session** — today users sign in with GitHub OAuth (Supabase), then *separately* click "Connect GitHub" in Settings → Integrations to run a second OAuth flow. Supabase's sign-in session already returns `provider_token` with `repo` scope — we should pull it off `session.provider_token` on first login and store it as the workspace's GitHub integration token, skipping the second flow.
- [ ] **Load-bearing eslint-disables** — a few `eslint-disable-next-line` / `@ts-ignore` sites exist (`middleware/auth.ts` namespace augmentation, `apps/desktop/src/main/main.ts` console usage, Electron ERB build scripts). All intentional and low-risk; noted for a future "lint-cleanup" pass if it's ever worth the churn.
- [x] **Workspace endpoint returns empty `repos` + `integrations`** — Fixed 2026-04-19.
- [x] **Change default ports** — Changed from 3001 to 4747 to avoid conflicts with common dev servers
- [x] **Fix ESLint configuration** — Removed broken 'erb' extends, simplified config, fixed all lint errors
- [x] **Diff renderer — swap diff2html for Shiki-based `@pierre/diffs`** — syntax-highlighted hunks via `<PatchDiff>`. Dropped diff2html + DOMPurify. (2026-04-23)
- [x] **Pre-commit hook** — husky + lint-staged run the same ESLint CI runs, only on staged files. (2026-04-23)

**Obsoleted by the cloud-only refactor / later sessions (kept for history):**
- ~~Per-tool allowlist patterns (`Bash(git *)`-style)~~ — the permission system (`permissionService`, `tool_allowlist`, Approve/Deny cards) was removed; cloud providers gate their own runs.
- ~~Duplicate "Stop" button on running tasks~~ — resolved by the Session 52 task-screen action audit; Abort renders once, beside the terminal.
- ~~Task detail screen is sluggish~~ — fixed in Session 24 (per-frame `task:event` coalescing + memoized `BlockView`).
- ~~Inbox 3-dots menu does nothing~~ — the Inbox was removed end-to-end in Session 43.
- ~~Per-task "+NN -MM" badge~~ — shipped 2026-04-23, then removed with the local git working tree; provider PRs carry the diff now.
- ~~XTerm input disabled in strict-autonomous mode~~ / ~~Coder environments~~ / ~~Terminal output blanks on task switch~~ — all tied to the deleted PTY/XTerm/local-env paths.

## Known Gaps (tracked but not yet phased)

- **Multi-instance safety (advisory locks)**: the task dispatchers (`mergeQueueProcessor`, `prAutoMergeWatcher`) are read-check-dispatch with only an in-process tick guard — two backends on the same DB double-fire cloud fix tasks (observed June 2026 running local + Railway against one Supabase DB; the dispatch HTTP call makes the race window seconds wide, and the loser's task id is overwritten on persist, orphaning it from the active-run guard). Fix before running multiple replicas: `pg_try_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext('merge-queue:' || pr.id))` around `processHead` (and equivalent in the watcher), skipping silently when another instance holds the lock.
- **API rate limiting on the hosted backend**: the Railway deployment has no per-user/IP throttle in front of the REST surface.
- **Backend-down UX**: no graceful offline indicator beyond the WebSocket auto-reconnect loop when the hosted backend is unreachable.
- **Desktop testing**: ~3 trivial renderer test files vs 240+ backend tests. Full plan in `docs/TESTING.md` (Phases D/E: component/hook tests + Playwright E2E).
- **MacOS notarization**: `afterSign: .erb/scripts/notarize.js` is wired up but untested in the fastowl repo specifically.

**Resolved:**
- ~~Credential encryption at rest~~ — integration tokens are AES-GCM envelopes via `services/tokenCrypto.ts` (`TALYN_TOKEN_KEY`); used by GitHub + PostHog Code credentials.
- ~~Backend bundling for release~~ / ~~Release packaging~~ — the backend is hosted (Railway, Phase 18.4); the desktop artifact doesn't need to ship it.
- ~~Multi-step agent state recovery~~ — no local agents to recover; cloud providers own run durability, the poller reconciles status.

  - [x] Phase B cont'd: agentService lifecycle + init + cleanupStaleAgents, agentStructured (start/stop/sendMessage/resumeRun/truncation), prMonitor, ai, websocket, taskFileWatcher, daemonProxyHandler, daemonAutoUpdate, taskPullRequest, gitContext, claudeCli, commitMessagePrefetch, github, middleware/auth.
  - [x] Phase C (mostly done): routes/tasks lifecycle + live-diff, routes/inbox, routes/backlog, routes/daemon, routes/permission, routes/github, routes/repositories, routes/environments. A few small routes still uncovered.
  - [x] Daemon package tests: config, executor, git, version, proxyServer, wsClient, selfUpdate (98 tests across 7 files).
  - [ ] Phase D: Frontend hook + component tests (e.g. `useTaskFiles`, `AgentConversation`, `QueuePanel` row rendering)
  - [ ] Phase E: Playwright E2E for 5 golden flows

- [ ] **12.6 Documentation**
  - [ ] User guide
  - [ ] Developer docs
  - [ ] API documentation

- [ ] **12.7 Multi-Tenant Backend (Future)**
  - [x] User authentication (Phase 18.2 — Supabase GitHub OAuth, JWT middleware, owner_id on top-level tables, RLS, desktop login + CLI/MCP bearer token)
  - [x] Data isolation (owner_id scoping via workspaces/environments, RLS as defense in depth)
  - [ ] API rate limiting
  - [ ] Deployment configuration
  - [ ] **Invite flow (TODO)** — today anyone with a GitHub account can sign up to a fresh instance; self-hosters use `TALYN_ALLOWED_EMAILS` to lock down. Need a proper `workspaces_users` join table, invitation tokens, and UI for inviting teammates before this is truly multi-tenant.

- [x] **12.8 Appearance** (COMPLETED)
  - [x] Light mode theme
  - [x] Theme toggle in settings (Appearance section)

  - [x] Remove required name/description fields (prompt-first for automated tasks)
  - [x] Auto-generate task name from prompt (Haiku LLM call via AI service)
  - [x] Show generating indicator while creating
  - [x] Allow editing generated name (in collapsed section)

- [x] **13.4 Repository Context** (COMPLETED)
  - [x] Repository selector in CreateTaskModal
  - [x] Spawn Claude in correct repo directory for task (via workingDirectory)
  - [x] Support multiple repos per workspace
  - [ ] Auto-clone repos on environment setup (optional) — deferred

## Phase 14: Git-Centric Workflow

- [x] **14.1 Task Branch Management** (COMPLETED)
  - [x] Auto-create branch when code-writing task starts (`fastowl/{id}-{slug}`)
  - [x] Track branch per task in database
  - [x] Auto-checkout branch when resuming task
  - [x] One active task per repo per environment (DONE — `findTaskHoldingEnvRepoSlot` in `taskQueue.ts`; both scheduler and `/start` refuse to stomp)

- [x] **14.2 Work State Preservation** (COMPLETED)
  - [x] Before starting new task: base branch is fetched and fast-forwarded via `gitService.prepareTaskBranch`
  - [x] Detect uncommitted changes (gitService.hasUncommittedChanges)
  - [x] `prepareTaskBranch` refuses to start on a dirty tree — the (env, repo) slot should have prevented it; surface the inconsistency rather than branch off half-written state
  - [x] Stash utility available (gitService.stashChanges)

- [x] **14.3 Branch Lifecycle** (COMPLETED — core flow)
  - [x] Delete local branch after approve — branch is pushed to origin then removed locally so the env+repo slot is free
  - [x] Push branch to remote on approve (`gitService.pushBranch` called from `/approve`)
  - [x] Rejected work preserved under `refs/fastowl/rejected/<taskId>` via `gitService.stashToBackupRef` (recoverable with `git checkout -b <name> <ref>`)
  - [ ] List task branches in UI (deferred — not needed once approve→push→delete lands)

- [x] **14.4 PR Creation from Task** (PARTIAL — commit+push landed; PR button deferred)
  - [x] Approve commits the working tree with an LLM-generated message (Haiku via `generateCommitMessage`) and pushes to origin — remote branch is ready for a PR
  - [x] Editable commit message modal in `ApproveTaskModal.tsx` — shift-click Approve to bypass
  - [ ] "Create PR" button on completed tasks (deferred — `gh pr create` wrapper)
  - [ ] Pre-fill PR title/description from task metadata (deferred)
  - [ ] Link PR to task in UI (deferred)

- [x] **14.5 Live file-change view** (COMPLETED)
  - [x] Per-file diff endpoints (`GET /:id/diff/files`, `GET /:id/diff/file?path=...`)
  - [x] `TaskFilesPanel` component — file list + per-file diff viewer; in-flight write pulse from `tool_use` events
  - [x] Terminal/Files tabs in the running-task view; Files tab replaces the inline diff in awaiting_review
  - [x] Live `task:files_changed` WS event driven by `taskFileWatcher` — debounces on `tool_use` for Edit/Write/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit/Bash

- [ ] **14.6 Future: parallel tasks per repo via git worktrees** (DEFERRED)
  - Reasoning: worktrees would drop the (env, repo) single-slot constraint and let multiple tasks work the same repo simultaneously. The blocker is per-worktree dependency state — each worktree needs its own `node_modules` / build artifacts, which is painful in monorepos (posthog/posthog, etc.). Keep single-slot for now; revisit if users hit the queue-behind-awaiting-review pain.

- [ ] **14.7 Future: resume task from a different environment**
  - Periodic `git push -f origin refs/fastowl/wip/<taskId>` from the env running the task; "Move to env X" action fetches + checks out on the target. Lightweight; tackle after users ask for it.

## Phase 15: Session Persistence & History

- [x] **15.1 Conversation Logging** (COMPLETED — raw terminal output)
  - [x] Persist all terminal output to task record (tasks.terminal_output column, append-only)
  - [ ] Store structured conversation (user messages, agent responses, tool calls) — deferred
  - [ ] Persist agent state snapshots — deferred
  - [ ] ndJson format for efficient append — chose plain-text column for simplicity

- [ ] **15.2 Session Resume**
  - [ ] Reconstruct conversation state from logs
  - [ ] Resume Claude session with context (if Claude CLI supports)
  - [ ] Fallback: start new session with conversation summary
  - [ ] "Continue where I left off" functionality

- [x] **15.3 Task History UI** (COMPLETED — basic)
  - [x] View full conversation history for any task (TerminalHistory component in TaskDetail)
  - [x] Scroll through past terminal output (XTerm in read-only mode)
  - [x] Collapsible section (expand/collapse toggle)
  - [ ] Collapsible tool use sections (requires structured log — deferred)
  - [ ] Search within task history — deferred

- [ ] **15.4 Agent Reuse (Investigate)**
  - [ ] Research: Can Claude CLI sessions be paused/frozen?
  - [ ] Research: MCP session persistence capabilities
  - [ ] If possible: implement session serialization
  - [ ] If not: implement context summarization for new sessions

## Phase 16: Task Types & Approval Workflows

- [x] **16.1 Task Type System** (COMPLETED)
  - [x] Define task types: code_writing, pr_response, pr_review, manual (TaskType union in shared)
  - [x] Type-specific behaviors (isAgentTask helper; queue auto-processes anything !== 'manual')
  - [x] Type icons in CreateTaskModal and QueuePanel (Sparkles/MessageSquare/Eye/Hand)
  - [x] Type-specific prompt placeholders in CreateTaskModal
  - [ ] Type-specific default prompts/templates (deferred — just placeholders for now)
  - [x] Migration 005 renames existing 'automated' → 'code_writing'

- [x] **16.2 Approval Gates** (COMPLETED)
  - [x] "Awaiting Review" status routed through (existing `awaiting_review` TaskStatus)
  - [x] Approve/Reject buttons in TaskDetail for awaiting_review tasks
  - [x] "Ready for Review" button in TaskTerminal stops agent + transitions to awaiting_review
  - [x] Agent session close (code === 0) now routes agent tasks to awaiting_review instead of completed
  - [x] Reject resets working tree to base, preserves rejected work under `refs/fastowl/rejected/<taskId>`, re-queues the task with `branch` cleared so the next attempt gets a fresh `prepareTaskBranch`
  - [x] Show diff of changes before approve — replaced inline `TaskDiff` with `TaskFilesPanel` (per-file list + diff viewer) that updates live via `task:files_changed`
  - [x] Commit message review modal with LLM-generated default (Haiku, see `generateCommitMessage`), shift-click to bypass
  - [x] Push only after approval — `/approve` commits the working tree, pushes to origin, then cleans up the local branch
  - [ ] Comments on approval (deferred)

- [ ] **16.3 PR Response Task Type**
  - [ ] Triggered by PR comment notifications
  - [ ] Auto-checkout PR branch
  - [ ] Review comments and implement changes
  - [ ] Wait for approval before pushing
  - [ ] Auto-create if configured in automation rules

- [ ] **16.4 PR Review Task Type**
  - [ ] Review someone else's PR
  - [ ] Suggest review comments (not post immediately)
  - [ ] Show suggested comments in UI
  - [ ] User approves which comments to post
  - [ ] Batch post approved comments

- [x] **16.5 Task Completion Model** (COMPLETED)
  - [x] Agent tasks: complete only after user approval (approve button in awaiting_review)
  - [x] Status flow: in_progress → awaiting_review → completed/queued (rejected)
  - [ ] Manual-task completion UX (still uses generic status picker — minor polish)

## Phase 17: Automation & Triggers

- [ ] **17.1 Automation Rules (Enhanced)**
  - [ ] PR comment on my PR → create PR Response task
  - [ ] CI failure → create fix task
  - [ ] New PR for review → create PR Review task (optional)
  - [ ] Configure per workspace

- [ ] **17.2 Auto-Start Behavior**
  - [ ] Option to auto-start triggered tasks
  - [ ] Option to just create inbox item for manual start
  - [ ] Rate limiting (max concurrent auto-tasks)

- [x] **17.3 Notification Preferences** (Session 17, basic)
  - [x] Desktop OS notifications for `awaiting_review` transitions — fires a native notification via the renderer's `Notification` API (Electron auto-bridges to macOS Notification Center / Windows Action Center / Linux libnotify)
  - [x] Toggle in Settings → Appearance → Notifications; preference persisted in localStorage
  - [x] Only fires on true status transitions (not idempotent restates)
  - [ ] Per-task-type notification settings — deferred (currently only awaiting_review)
  - [ ] Digest mode (batch notifications) — deferred

## Phase 18: Hosted Backend + Local Daemon

> **Goal**: move from local-only SQLite backend to a hosted control plane (Supabase Postgres + containerized Node server) with a local daemon on the user's machine that handles environment/agent execution. Preserves local-first execution while enabling cross-device state, multi-user auth, and proper productionization.
>
> **Reference architecture**: hosted server owns state + integrations; local daemon owns SSH/PTY/Claude CLI execution; they communicate via an authenticated outbound WebSocket tunnel from the daemon to the server.

- [ ] **18.1 DB abstraction + Postgres/Supabase migration**
  - [ ] Pick a TypeScript ORM with migration tooling — **recommended: Drizzle ORM + drizzle-kit**
  - [ ] Define schema in Drizzle, translate existing `db/index.ts` migrations (001-005) into Drizzle migration files
  - [ ] Introduce a `DatabaseClient` interface so routes/services don't depend on `better-sqlite3` directly
  - [ ] Add Supabase project + wire `DATABASE_URL` env var
  - [ ] `npm run db:migrate` script (drizzle-kit migrate); `npm run db:generate` for new migrations
  - [ ] Keep SQLite as the local-mode default (single-user path) during transition

- [ ] **18.2 Auth + multi-tenancy**
  - [ ] Supabase Auth with GitHub OAuth (reuses existing GitHub integration)
  - [ ] Add `user_id` column on workspaces, environments, tasks, inbox_items, integrations, repositories
  - [ ] Enforce user scoping in every route handler (Supabase RLS policies + server-side checks)
  - [ ] Login UI in desktop app (sign in with GitHub → receive JWT → store in secure local storage)
  - [ ] Auth middleware on Express routes + WebSocket upgrade

- [ ] **18.3 Split backend into server + daemon**
  - [~] New `packages/server` — hosted control plane. 18.3.A landed the daemon-on-the-other-side of the split; dropping ssh2/node-pty from the backend waits until legacy `local`/`ssh` env types are deprecated.
  - [x] New `packages/daemon` — `@talyn/daemon` workspace with `executor.ts`, `git.ts`, `wsClient.ts`, `config.ts`, `proxyServer.ts`. Session 15–16.
  - [x] Wire protocol in `@talyn/shared/daemonProtocol.ts`: hello / request-response / events + proxy_http_request. Session 15–16.
  - [x] Daemon auth: one-shot pairing token → long-lived device token (SHA-256 hash stored). Session 15.
  - [x] **Option-1 HTTP relay for CLI/MCP inside tasks**: daemon runs a localhost HTTP proxy; child processes' REST calls tunnel over the daemon's authenticated WS. Backend accepts internal-auth headers (randomBytes(48) secret, timingSafeEqual) alongside JWT. No user JWT ever lives on the VM. Session 16.
  - [x] **Scheduler/backlog recognise daemon envs**: `daemonRegistry` updates `environments.status` on connect/disconnect; backlog + continuousBuildScheduler treat connected daemon envs as eligible fallbacks. Session 16.
  - [x] **Bundled daemon**: installed as a launchd/systemd user service by the Electron app on first launch (Session 19 Slices 2+3). Runs outside Electron's lifetime, so quitting the app doesn't kill in-flight tasks.
  - [~] **Deployable daemon**: `fastowl-daemon` distributable to VMs (Session 17)
    - [x] Single-file binary — cross-compiled via `bun build --compile` for darwin-arm64/x64, linux-x64/arm64, win-x64 (Session 19 Slice 1); shipped inside the Electron `.app` via `extraResources`.
    - [x] Systemd unit / launchd plist for auto-start — generated by `scripts/install-daemon.sh`
    - [x] Self-register with hosted server on first run using a one-time pairing token from the desktop app — pairing flow works end-to-end from the new "Add Environment" UI
  - [~] **Remote install flow**: originally shipped as SSH auto-install (Session 17); replaced in Session 19 Slice 5 with a "paste this one-liner on the VM" pairing flow when env types collapsed to `local | remote` and ssh2 was dropped.
    - [x] Desktop UI: simplified pairing modal — name the env, mint pairing token, show install one-liner, poll until daemon dials in
    - [x] Health check: desktop polls env status after install, flips to "connected" when the daemon dials back via `daemonRegistry.register`
    - [x] Uninstall flow: symmetric — app menu → "Uninstall Talyn daemon and quit…" for the local daemon; bundled `scripts/fastowl-uninstall.sh` for the `.app` (Session 19 Slice 7).

- [x] **18.4 Deployment** (Session 14)
  - [x] Multi-stage Dockerfile at repo root — Node 22 slim, copies pre-built node_modules from builder to avoid re-running install-scripts (keeps node-pty/ssh2 native bindings without runtime build tools)
  - [x] `railway.toml` — DOCKERFILE builder, `/health` healthcheck, on-failure restart
  - [x] Hosted at `https://fastowl-backend-production.up.railway.app`, project `Talyn`, service `fastowl-backend`
  - [x] Service variables: `DATABASE_URL` (transaction pooler, not direct — Railway has no IPv6), `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `TALYN_ALLOWED_EMAILS`, `NODE_ENV`
  - [x] Migrations run on startup via drizzle-orm migrator; `build:copy-migrations` postbuild script puts `.sql` files into `dist/`
  - [ ] Rate limiting on public API (per-user) — future

- [x] **18.5 CI for hosted backend** (Session 14, partial)
  - [x] `.github/workflows/deploy-backend.yml` — path-filtered to backend/shared/Dockerfile, uses `RAILWAY_TOKEN` secret
  - [ ] Separate staging vs production environments (Railway environments feature) — future
  - [ ] Automated Supabase branch creation for PR previews — future
  - [ ] Rollback procedure documented — future

- [x] **18.6 Desktop app integration** (mostly Session 13 + 14)
  - [x] Replace hardcoded `http://localhost:4747` with configurable server URL (`TALYN_API_URL` env, webpack EnvironmentPlugin, loaded via dotenv)
  - [x] Desktop points at Railway by default; local fallback via `.env` override
  - [x] Graceful degradation when backend unreachable (App.tsx renders "Backend is unreachable" screen)
  - [ ] First-run flow: choose "Cloud (hosted)" vs "Self-hosted/local" mode — future, not required for production
  - [ ] Encrypt stored JWT at rest via OS keychain (Electron safeStorage API) — future, localStorage persists fine for MVP

- [ ] **18.7 Data migration for existing users**
  - [ ] One-click "Sync to cloud" flow reads local SQLite and pushes to hosted Postgres
  - [ ] Preserve task history, inbox items, workspace config

- [ ] **18.8 Observability — PostHog**
  - PostHog is the single product analytics + error tracking + logs platform for Talyn; no separate Sentry/Datadog/etc.
  - [ ] Structured logging on server (pino), shipped to PostHog via log-to-events
  - [ ] Error tracking via PostHog error tracking (server + daemon + Electron renderer + main process)
  - [ ] Product analytics events: task created, task approved/rejected, env added, integration connected, time-to-first-agent
  - [ ] PostHog session replay for desktop UX debugging (opt-in only)
  - [ ] Railway platform metrics → PostHog (CPU/mem/request counts) via webhook or periodic push
  - [ ] Dashboards: cohort retention, error rate by route, approval latency histogram
  - [ ] Self-host PostHog or PostHog Cloud — defer decision; cloud is faster to start

## Phase 19: Developer Tooling

> Tools that speed up the dev loop. Add/maintain as we go.

- [ ] **19.1 MCP servers for Claude Code**
  - [ ] **GitHub MCP** (`@modelcontextprotocol/server-github`) — query repo state, PRs, issues, runs
  - [ ] **Supabase MCP** (`@supabase/mcp-server-supabase`) — query hosted DB schema and rows during dev
  - [ ] **PostHog MCP** — query analytics/errors from the editor
  - [ ] **Filesystem MCP** (optional) — scoped to the repo root
  - [ ] Document the MCP setup in [`docs/SETUP.md`](./SETUP.md)

- [ ] **19.2 Scripts + DX polish**
  - [ ] `npm run db:reset` — drop the local SQLite DB and recreate via migrations
  - [ ] `npm run db:seed` — optional seed data for demo purposes
  - [ ] `npm run logs` — tail backend + desktop main-process logs in one stream
  - [ ] Pre-commit hook (husky + lint-staged) for typecheck + eslint on changed files only

- [ ] **19.3 Local `claude` CLI smoke harness**
  - [ ] Fixture transcripts + a test harness that replays them into `agent.analyzeOutput()` to catch regressions

## Phase 20: Continuous Build

> Point Talyn at a TODO document and it works through the list — one task per item, each with its own git branch, each gated by human approval. See [`docs/CONTINUOUS_BUILD.md`](./CONTINUOUS_BUILD.md) for the full feature doc.

- [x] **20.1 Backlog data model + markdown parser** (COMPLETED)
  - [x] `backlog_sources` + `backlog_items` tables (migrations 006, 007)
  - [x] Markdown checklist parser with heading-scoped sections, nesting, `(blocked)` detection
  - [x] Stable external IDs (hash of text + parent) so reordering doesn't churn state
  - [x] Source sync: read file via `environmentService.exec`, upsert items, retire missing ones
  - [x] REST at `/api/v1/backlog` for sources CRUD + sync + item list
  - [x] 18 unit/service tests (parser + service)

- [x] **20.2 Continuous Build scheduler** (COMPLETED)
  - [x] Domain EventEmitter (`services/events.ts`) so backend services can react to `task:status` transitions without going through websocket
  - [x] Scheduler subscribes to `task:status`, updates backlog item claim/completion, and spawns the next unblocked item when slots are available
  - [x] Workspace-level `continuousBuild.{ enabled, maxConcurrent, requireApproval }` settings
  - [x] Manual-kick endpoint `POST /api/v1/backlog/schedule`
  - [x] Periodic tick (60s) as a safety net for missed events
  - [x] 8 scheduler tests (on/off, cap, approval gate, claim/release, disabled-source skip)

- [x] **20.3 Desktop UI** (COMPLETED)
  - [x] New **Continuous Build** section in Settings: toggle + concurrent cap + approval gate
  - [x] Source management: add/delete markdown_file sources with per-source environment
  - [x] Backlog items view with live status chips (pending/in-flight/done/blocked)
  - [x] "Run scheduler" button

- [x] **20.4 Talyn CLI (task-spawns-task)** (COMPLETED)
  - [x] New `packages/cli` workspace publishing the `talyn` binary
  - [x] Commands: `task create/list/ready`, `backlog sources/sync/items/schedule`, `ping`
  - [x] Agent service injects `TALYN_API_URL` (local), `TALYN_WORKSPACE_ID`, `TALYN_TASK_ID` as inline env vars on spawn so child Claudes inherit context
  - [x] 3 CLI client tests + 4 backend env-prefix tests

- [x] **20.5 SSH VM support** (COMPLETED — documentation, code path, and one-command bootstrap)
  - [x] Env prefix skips `TALYN_API_URL` for SSH environments (remote `.bashrc` sets it instead)
  - [x] `docs/SSH_VM_SETUP.md` with three networking options (SSH reverse tunnel, LAN bind, backend-on-VM) and troubleshooting
  - [x] `scripts/bootstrap-vm.sh` — idempotent one-command VM install
  - [ ] End-to-end user verification on the real VM (requires user action)

- [x] **20.8 Option 3 — deterministic completion for autonomous tasks** (COMPLETED)
  - [x] Autonomous tasks (those with `metadata.backlogItemId`) spawn `claude --print --permission-mode acceptEdits <prompt>` via the existing `bash -c` non-interactive path
  - [x] Process exit = completion signal. No prompt-based signaling, no hook, no sentinel
  - [x] Interactive tasks keep the existing PTY + prompt-delivery flow
  - [x] Scheduler `buildPrompt` rewritten: tells Claude to stop responding when done (exit is the signal)
  - [x] Fix: SSH `pty:close` now carries the real exit code; agent close handler forwards it
  - [x] Fix: scheduler skips sources whose target environment isn't connected

- [x] **20.6 Talyn MCP server** (COMPLETED)
  - [x] New `packages/mcp-server` workspace using `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` over stdio
  - [x] Seven tools: `talyn_create_task`, `talyn_list_tasks`, `talyn_mark_ready_for_review`, `talyn_list_backlog_items`, `talyn_list_backlog_sources`, `talyn_sync_backlog_source`, `talyn_schedule`
  - [x] Tools pick up `TALYN_WORKSPACE_ID` / `TALYN_TASK_ID` from env so child Claudes call them argument-free
  - [x] Registration instructions in `docs/SETUP.md` (Talyn MCP section)
  - [x] 7 handler tests

- [ ] **20.7 Nice-to-haves (deferred)**
  - [ ] GitHub issues as a backlog source type
  - [ ] Linear projects as a backlog source type
  - [ ] Priority inference from source context (currently every item is `medium`)
  - [ ] Cross-source scheduling priority (currently iterates in creation order)
  - [ ] Structured `<!-- depends-on: ... -->` annotations for blocked items
