# Backend image for Railway. Multi-stage: a builder that installs the
# whole workspace and runs tsc, then a slim runtime that keeps only the
# backend's compiled output plus the node_modules the builder prepared.
#
# The backend has no native deps after the "daemon everywhere" refactor
# (ssh2 + node-pty were dropped). build-essential is retained in the
# builder image as cheap insurance in case a transitive dep grows a
# native binding later.
