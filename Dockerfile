# Backend image for Railway. Multi-stage: a builder that installs the
# whole workspace and runs tsc, then a slim runtime that keeps only the
# backend's compiled output plus the node_modules the builder prepared.
#
# The backend has no native deps after the "daemon everywhere" refactor
# (ssh2 + node-pty were dropped). build-essential is retained in the
# builder image as cheap insurance in case a transitive dep grows a
# native binding later.

# Tailscale, for reaching self-hosted fleet hosts.
#
# A fleet host binds loopback and must never be exposed publicly (fleet spec
# §16.4), so the backend needs a private path to it. Spec §15 risk 5 asks for a
# WireGuard mesh; a tailnet is the same idea with key distribution solved.
#
# USERSPACE MODE, because a PaaS container has no NET_ADMIN and cannot create a
# TUN device. tailscaled instead exposes a local HTTP proxy and the fleet client
# dials through it (see services/selfHosted/client.ts). Nothing else in the
# backend's networking changes, and with no TS_AUTHKEY the daemon never starts
# at all — the image behaves exactly as it did before.
#
# Pinned and checksummed like every other fetched artifact.
