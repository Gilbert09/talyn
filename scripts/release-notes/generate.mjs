/**
 * Generate a release's "What's new" highlights from its commits and post them
 * to the backend.
 *
 * Run by the `release-notes` job in .github/workflows/publish.yml, after the
 * macOS leg has created the GitHub release — so a version that failed to build
 * is never announced.
 *
 * The pipeline is: compare the previous release tag to HEAD → keep only the
 * commits that could possibly matter to a user (`filterReleaseCommits` from
 * @talyn/shared, the same filter the tests pin) → ask Claude to turn what
 * survives into user-facing highlights → POST them.
 *
 * Two filters, deliberately. The mechanical one drops merge commits,
 * non-user commit types, internal scopes, and scopes still behind an allow-list
 * (`GATED_SCOPES`) without any judgement; the model answers the judgement
 * question ("would a user notice this?") on what's left. Either one alone gets
 * it wrong: the filter can't tell a plumbing `fix(github)` from a visible one,
 * it can't tell that a `fix(desktop)` is about a gated page, and the model
 * shouldn't be spending attention on `chore(deps)`.
 *
 * Nothing here may fail a release. The job is `continue-on-error`, this script
 * exits 0 on every soft failure, and an empty highlight list is a normal
 * outcome that still gets posted (the row is what keeps `?since=` honest).
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/release-notes/generate.mjs [--dry-run]
 *
 * Env:
 *   GITHUB_REPOSITORY            owner/repo
 *   GITHUB_TOKEN                 for the compare API
 *   PREVIOUS_TAG                 the release before this one, e.g. v0.2.60
 *   HEAD_SHA                     the commit being released
 *   RELEASE_VERSION              X.Y.Z (no leading v)
 *   CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN      omit to skip generation entirely. A Claude
 *                                subscription token from `claude setup-token`,
 *                                NOT a console API key — see callClaude.
 *   TALYN_API_URL                backend root, e.g. https://prod.talyn.dev
 *   TALYN_RELEASE_INGEST_SECRET  omit to skip the POST

const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You write the "What's new" notes for Talyn, a desktop and web app for managing GitHub pull requests with cloud coding agents.

You are given the commits from one release. Turn them into the short list a Talyn user would want to read after an update.

What earns a highlight: something the user can see or do differently. New capabilities, changed behaviour they would notice, fixes to problems they would have hit, and speedups they would feel.

What does not: internal refactors, test changes, dependency bumps, build and CI work, logging and instrumentation, anything on the operator console or the marketing site, and fixes to bugs that only ever existed on an unreleased branch.

And what must NOT, even when it is the most interesting thing in the release: anything the commit tells you is not available to users yet — behind an allow-list, behind a feature flag, gated to specific accounts, or described as not yet enabled. Announcing one of those is worse than announcing nothing, because the user is told about something they cannot open AND the release is then marked as read, so the real launch is never announced. When a release contains only gated work, the correct answer is an empty list.

Merge commits that tell one story into one highlight. Three commits iterating on the same feature are one highlight describing the finished feature, not three.

Returning an empty list is a correct and common answer. Most nights contain nothing a user would notice. Do not manufacture a highlight to avoid an empty list.

For each highlight:
- title: under 60 characters, sentence case, no trailing period. Name the thing, not the change ("Watch a PR you did not write", not "Added PR watching").
- description: exactly one sentence, written for someone using the app. Say what they can now do or what now works. No commit-speak, no file paths, no PR or issue numbers, no function or table names, no mention of commits or releases.
- kind: "feature" for something new, "fix" for something repaired, "improvement" for something that got faster or better without being new.
- surfaces: which clients it applies to. A commit scoped (desktop) is desktop only, (web) is web only, everything else is both. Backend changes are almost always both.`;

/**
 * The JSON contract, spelled out in the prompt.
 *

 * the reply and made the model retry its own mismatch. Running on a Claude
 * SUBSCRIPTION means going through the Claude Code CLI instead of the Messages
 * API, and the CLI has no equivalent — so the shape is stated here, checked on
 * the way back, and asked for once more if it comes back wrong. `normalize`
 * still drops anything malformed, which is what actually protects the POST.

/**
 * Ask Claude, through the Claude Code CLI.
 *
 * The CLI rather than `@anthropic-ai/sdk` because this runs on Tom's Claude
 * subscription: the Messages API only takes a console API key, whereas the CLI
 * authenticates with the long-lived token from `claude setup-token`, which is
 * what a Pro/Max subscription can issue. Nothing about the job is worth a
 * metered API key — it is a handful of commit subjects, once a night.
 *
 * Flags that matter:
 *   --system-prompt   REPLACES Claude Code's default prompt rather than adding
 *                     to it. That is the point: the default carries the coding
 *                     agent's scaffolding and this repo's CLAUDE.md, tens of
 *                     thousands of tokens of instructions for a job that is
 *                     "read these commit subjects and write three sentences".
 *   --max-turns 1     One answer. There is nothing here to iterate on, and a
 *                     tool call would just burn the turn.
 *   --output-format   Gives the envelope below instead of bare text, so a
 *                     failure can be told apart from a short answer.
 *
 * The prompt goes in as an argv element via execFile — no shell — so a commit
 * subject full of quotes and backticks is data, not syntax.
