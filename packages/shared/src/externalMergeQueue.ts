// External merge queues (trunk.io, GitHub's native merge queue) — shared vocabulary.
//
// Some base branches are governed by a merge system Talyn can't merge past: a
// ruleset restricts who may UPDATE the ref and exempts only that system's app.
// posthog/posthog's `master` has been one since July 2026 (the "Trunk merge"
// ruleset), so the direct merge 405s with "Cannot update this protected ref".
//
// Talyn's queue still does the valuable half: take the PR to green (fix runs,
// branch updates, re-signs, check re-runs), SUBMIT it to that system, then
// track it there and re-fix if it gets ejected. This module is the shared
// vocabulary the backend pipeline and the desktop badges both read.
//
// TWO channels carry trunk's state, and the authoritative one is the comment:
//
//  - **Its own PR comment.** Trunk posts ONE comment per PR and EDITS IT IN
//    PLACE through the whole lifecycle: the submit instruction becomes "✨
//    Submitted to Merge", then "🧪 Running tests…", then "😎 Merged
//    successfully" (or a 🚫/❌/⚠️ failure). This always exists — it's how trunk
//    talks to humans — so it's the channel to trust.
//  - **Status labels** (`trunk-queued`, `trunk-testing`, …). Configurable, and
//    on posthog/posthog they're applied only sometimes: #74552 went through a
//    full test cycle without ever being labelled, and PRs that merged hours ago
//    still carry a stale `trunk-testing`. Reading state off labels alone made
//    Talyn declare "the queue never picked it up" for seven PRs trunk was
//    actively testing (2026-07-29) — hence the comment channel.

/**
 * Where a submitted PR sits in the external queue.
 *
 * `failed`/`ejected`/`cancelled` are the EJECTED states — the provider gave the
 * PR back, and Talyn's queue takes over again. They differ in what it gave back
 * WITH, which is what decides the response:
 *
 *   `failed`    — it tested the PR and the tests failed. There is failure
 *                 output to start a fix run from.
 *   `ejected`   — it handed the PR back for a reason that is not a test
 *                 failure (a push landed on the branch, it waited too long for
 *                 the PR to become mergeable) and asked for a resubmit. Nothing
 *                 to read; remediate whatever the PR's own blockers are and go
 *                 round again.
 *   `cancelled` — it was removed for a reason this parser doesn't recognise,
 *                 which may be a human pulling it out deliberately. Terminal:
 *                 overriding that is not a repair.
 *
 * `pending_failure` is NOT one of them, however much it reads like `failed`.
 * Trunk saw a required check fail in the batch but still has the PR: it waits
 * for the PRs ahead to finish, because one of them may be the real culprit,
 * and then either retests this PR or removes it ("removed from the merge queue
 * because it failed tests", which is `failed`). Every PR behind it is testing
 * on top of it meanwhile, so a push here resets all of them.
 *
 * `not_submitted` and `rejected` are only ever read off the provider's comment:
 * the first says its submit box is untouched (it does NOT have the PR), the
 * second that it refuses to merge this PR at all — neither is something a fix
 * run or a resubmit can move, so both need a human.
