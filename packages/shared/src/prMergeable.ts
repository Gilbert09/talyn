      - \`git_signed_commit\` — publishes your staged changes (\`git add\` first) as a new commit on the PR branch. Use this for all ordinary work: review fixes, CI fixes, etc.
      - \`git_signed_merge\` — brings the base branch (${baseBranch}) into the PR branch SERVER-SIDE, as a true two-parent Verified merge commit (the same machinery as GitHub's "Update branch" button). No local merge, no history rewriting.
      - \`git_signed_rewrite\` — republishes the branch after a LOCAL rebase. This is the only sanctioned force-update, and the rebase-for-conflicts flow below is its only sanctioned use here.
  - To incorporate changes from ${baseBranch}, ALWAYS call \`git_signed_merge\` first. NEVER run a local \`git merge origin/${baseBranch}\` and then \`git_signed_commit\`: the commit tool refuses while a merge is in progress, because publishing through it would LINEARIZE the merge into a single-parent commit — the base never becomes an ancestor, so the PR diff attributes EVERY file the base changed to your branch (hundreds of unrelated files leaking into the PR). This has actually happened.
  - Rebase is ONLY for conflicts, and only after \`git_signed_merge\` has reported one: \`git fetch origin ${baseBranch}\`, \`git rebase origin/${baseBranch}\`, resolve each conflict, \`git add\` the resolutions, \`git rebase --continue\` (NOT \`git commit\`), then publish with \`git_signed_rewrite\`. Never rebase for any other reason, and never try to publish a rebase any other way.
  - NEVER bring the base's changes in as a single-parent imitation of a merge: no \`git merge --squash\`, \`git read-tree\`, \`git checkout ${baseBranch} -- .\`, \`git diff base | git apply\`, etc. The base must become an ANCESTOR of your branch — via \`git_signed_merge\`'s two-parent merge commit, or via a rebase ONTO it. Naming a single-parent commit "Merge branch '${baseBranch}'" does not make it a merge.
  - A signed git tool's REFUSAL is authoritative ("merge in progress", "base leak", merge commits in a rewrite range, …). Read its error and follow the recovery path it describes — do not retry the same call and do not work around it. If you're stuck mid-operation, \`git merge --abort\` / \`git rebase --abort\` returns you to a clean state to start over from.`;

      - \`fleet-publish --branch <branch> --message "<headline>" [--body "<longer text>"]\` — publishes your working tree as ONE commit that GitHub signs server-side. Use this for all ordinary work: review fixes, CI fixes, etc. It diffs against the merge-base with the default branch, so commit locally or not as you prefer — only the final file contents matter.
      - \`fleet-publish --move-branch <branch> --oid <sha>\` — repoints a branch at a commit you already published. This is the only sanctioned force-update, and the conflict flow below is its only sanctioned use here. It REWRITES the branch and discards its previous commits, so never reach for it while a server-side update would have worked.
  - Local git is fully available for inspection and for preparing changes: \`git fetch\`, \`git status\`, \`git diff\`, \`git log\`, \`git merge-base\`, \`git rev-list\`, and a LOCAL \`git rebase\` to resolve conflicts. None of it reaches the remote on its own — only \`fleet-publish\` and the GitHub API publish.
  - To incorporate changes from ${baseBranch}, make GITHUB perform the merge so the result is signed and the base becomes a true ANCESTOR of the PR branch — see the base-update flow below. NEVER fabricate a single-parent imitation of a merge (no \`git merge --squash\`, no \`git checkout ${baseBranch} -- .\`, no \`git read-tree\`, no "apply the base's diff"): that makes the base look like your work and leaks every file the base changed into the PR's diff (hundreds of unrelated files). Naming a single-parent commit "Merge branch '${baseBranch}'" does not make it a merge.
  - Never move the repository's default branch. The fleet will refuse it.

       git diff --name-only origin/${baseBranch}...HEAD   # save this "before" list
   - If the branch is BEHIND or CONFLICTING / DIRTY, first call \`git_signed_merge\` (per the git rules above). If it succeeds, the base is now merged in server-side as a true two-parent merge commit and your local checkout is synced — skip to the verification step.
   - ONLY if \`git_signed_merge\` reports a CONFLICT, resolve it with the rebase flow:
       git fetch origin ${baseBranch}
       git rebase origin/${baseBranch}
     For each conflicted file, resolve ONLY the genuine conflict: preserve the intent of BOTH sides; never blindly discard the PR's changes or the base's. Then \`git add\` the resolutions and \`git rebase --continue\` (NOT \`git commit\`), repeating until the rebase completes. Publish the rebased branch with \`git_signed_rewrite\`. Only ever rebase onto the PR's own base branch (\`origin/${baseBranch}\`) — never any other branch. If the rebase goes sideways, \`git rebase --abort\` and start it over — never leave it half-finished, and never try to publish it with \`git_signed_commit\`.
   - VERIFY THE UPDATE ACTUALLY JOINED THE BASE, whichever path ran (this is the #1 cause of mass file leaks — the base never truly becomes an ancestor). Both of these must hold:
       git fetch origin ${baseBranch}
       git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/${baseBranch} HEAD   # must exit 0 — the base tip is now an ancestor of your branch
       git rev-list --count HEAD..origin/${baseBranch}          # must print 0 — your branch is NOT behind the base anymore
     If either fails, the update did not take — re-read the tool output (a refusal explains its recovery path) and redo the update; do not proceed.
   - GUARD AGAINST BASE-BRANCH FILES LEAKING INTO THE PR. This is a real, recurring failure: a botched conflict resolution drags files that only changed on ${baseBranch} into the PR's diff. Catch it explicitly:
       a. AFTER the update (signed merge or completed rebase), record the file set again:
            git diff --name-only origin/${baseBranch}...HEAD   # the "after" list
       b. Compare with the "before" list you saved. The two MUST be identical. A clean base update adds NOTHING to the PR's own diff — files that already live on ${baseBranch} must never appear as PR changes. Any file in "after" that wasn't in "before" is a leak (usually a conflict resolved by re-adding base-only content, or a file deleted on one side wrongly kept).
       c. For every file still in the diff, eyeball it: \`git diff origin/${baseBranch}...HEAD -- <file>\`. Each hunk must be either this PR's intended work or a genuine conflict resolution. A hunk that just restates what's already on ${baseBranch} is a leak.
   - If you find ANY leaked file or hunk after a rebase, do not publish. \`git rebase --abort\` (or restart from the remote branch state — the remote is untouched until \`git_signed_rewrite\`) and redo the rebase, taking the base side for files this PR never meant to touch.
   - Do not publish until the "before" and "after" file sets match and every remaining hunk is intentional. Then re-run the build/tests locally where feasible and publish (\`git_signed_rewrite\` for a rebase; a server-side \`git_signed_merge\` needs no publish step). Updating the branch re-triggers CI and can reopen review threads, so re-check conditions (1) and (2) afterwards.`;
