// Release notes — the "What's new" feed behind the modal both front ends show
// after an update.
//
// Talyn cuts a stable release EVERY NIGHT, and most nights carry a handful of
// commits that no user would notice. Two consequences shape everything here:
//
//   1. The unit the user sees is not a release, it's the span between the
//      version they last saw and the one they're running — which may be a
//      dozen nightlies. `shouldShowWhatsNew` returns that span, and returns
//      nothing at all when the span has no user-facing content.
//   2. What reaches a highlight has to be filtered twice: once mechanically
//      (`filterReleaseCommits`, which drops merge commits, non-user commit
//      types, internal scopes, and scopes still behind an allow-list), and once
//      editorially by the model in CI.
//
// Everything in this file is pure and lives in @talyn/shared on purpose. The
// CI generator, the backend, the desktop renderer and apps/web all depend on
// the same version ordering and the same show/don't-show rule; `apps/web` is a
// deliberate fork of the desktop renderer, so a second copy of this logic is
// how the two clients start disagreeing about what a user has already seen.

 * automation was released to everybody, so the release that did it is the one
 * that announces it.

 * This is a mechanical backstop, not the whole answer. A gated feature's
 * commits do not all carry its scope — `fix(desktop): hide the Workflows nav
 * item while loading` is scoped `desktop` and slips straight through — so the
