 *
 * `CloudProviderType` is the closed set of providers *this* build knows how to
 * register, and it should stay closed: a `Record<CloudProviderType, ...>` that
 * stops compiling when a provider is added is a useful reminder to add its
 * label and logo. But the desktop app is a released Electron binary, so users
 * run old versions against a newer backend indefinitely. Anything that *reads*
 * a provider id off the wire — task metadata, an environment row, an API
 * response — must therefore accept a string it does not recognise and degrade,
 * rather than treat it as absent.
 *
 * The `(string & {})` intersection is the standard trick for "any string, but
 * keep autocompleting the known ones".
