/**
 * The operator console's API (admin.talyn.dev).
 *
 * # Why a new router rather than growing /debug and /fleet
 *
 * Both of those are consumed by SHIPPED desktop builds, and there is no API
 * version negotiation — `X-Talyn-Client-Version` is identification only, and
 * nothing branches on it. Reshaping their responses breaks installs in the
 * field that nobody can force-update.
 *
 * `/api/v1/fleet` has a second reason: it already has a split personality.
 * `fleetPublicRoutes()` mounts BEFORE requireAuth with a shared bearer so a
 * daemon can report in; `fleetRoutes()` mounts after. Adding drain and
 * golden-GC into that file would put destructive mutations one mount-order
 * typo away from the unauthenticated router.
 *
 * One mount also means one place to hang the mutation rate limiter, the reason
 * gate, and the audit context, instead of three files that have to remember.
 *
 * # Mount position
 *
 * Mounted BEFORE `ownerScope` (see routes/index.ts). This is not a preference:
 * `withOwnerScope` runs the request inside a transaction that drops to the
 * `authenticated` role so Postgres RLS applies, and every read here is
 * deliberately cross-tenant. Mounted below it, they would not error — they
 * would silently return zero rows, which is the worst available failure for a
 * console whose job is to show you what is happening across the deployment.
