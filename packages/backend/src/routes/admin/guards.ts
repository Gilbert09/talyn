/**
 * Guards for the operator console's mutating routes.
 *
 * These COMPOSE with `requireAdmin` rather than replacing it. `requireAdmin`
 * answers "is this an operator"; these answer "is this operator allowed to do
 * this specific thing, to this specific target, right now". Keeping them
 * separate means the read gate and the write gate cannot drift apart — there is
 * no path where relaxing one quietly relaxes the other.
 *
 * # Why guards at all, when there is one boolean and one operator
 *
 * Until now `is_admin` gated a read-only debug panel. It is about to gate
 * `plan_override` and `is_admin` itself. A roles table would be the textbook
 * answer and the wrong one here — there is one operator, and a permission model
 * nobody administers is a permission model that drifts out of date. What is
 * worth having is a handful of cheap, specific refusals that make the two
 * genuinely dangerous mutations hard to perform by accident and impossible to
 * perform invisibly.
