  // (posthog_oauth_states) is what authenticates it.
  app.use(`${api}/posthog`, mount(posthogPublicRoutes()));

  // Fleet hosts PUSH their state here every ~15s. The caller is fleetd — a
  // daemon on bare metal with no Supabase session — so this mounts before
  // requireAuth and authenticates with the shared FLEET_REPORT_TOKEN instead.

  // that would mean a hosted PaaS holding an inbound path to every machine
  // running untrusted code.
  app.use(`${api}/fleet`, mount(fleetPublicRoutes()));

  // The publish workflow POSTs a release's highlights here once the GitHub
  // release exists. Same shape of caller as the fleet report above — a CI job
  // with no Supabase session — so it mounts before requireAuth and
  // authenticates with TALYN_RELEASE_INGEST_SECRET. Its rate limiter is
  // attached to the POST route itself rather than to this mount: the READ
  // routes live at the same path (below, after requireAuth), and a mount-level
  // limiter here would spend the ingest's tight budget on ordinary launches
  // from every client behind one NAT.
  app.use(`${api}/release-notes`, mount(releaseNotesPublicRoutes()));

  // The hosted MCP endpoint authenticates with a personal MCP token (not a
  // Supabase JWT), so it mounts BEFORE requireAuth with its own gate. The
  // tool handlers call the authenticated REST API below over loopback with
  // internal-proxy headers, so owner scoping still applies end-to-end.
  // Every auth attempt on this mount is a DB round-trip (token lookup), so a
  // tighter per-IP limiter sits in FRONT of the gate: 300/min (5/s sustained)
  // is far above what a legitimate MCP client's tool-call cadence needs, but

  // Per-USER fair-use limit, on top of the per-IP ceiling above. IP alone
  // gets both directions wrong once there's a browser client: a whole office
  // behind one NAT egress shares a bucket they didn't individually fill,
  // while a single runaway user on a home connection never touches it. Same
  // 1000/min budget, now applied to the entity it was reasoned about — one
  // client peaks around 100 req/min, so this is ~10x headroom for a user
  // with several windows or tabs open.
  //
  // NOTE: the per-IP ceiling above is still 1000/min and is deliberately
  // NOT raised here. It bounds UNAUTHENTICATED work, and the expensive path
  // it protects is the legacy HS256 branch in verifyTokenAndGetUser, which
  // makes an outbound Supabase call per attempt. Revisit it (together with
  // that branch) when app.talyn.dev actually has NAT'd users — raising it
  // speculatively would widen that hole for no present gain.

  //
  // Pre-ownerScope with debug and fleet, and for a sharper reason than either:
  // every read here is deliberately cross-tenant, and ownerScope would not
  // error on them — it would silently return zero rows, which is the worst
  // available failure for a console whose job is to show what is happening
  // across the whole deployment.
  //
  // Its own per-user ceiling on top of the global one. A console page fans out
