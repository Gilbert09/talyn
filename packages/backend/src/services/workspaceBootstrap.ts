/**
 * Every owner has at least one workspace.
 *
 * Onboarding used to open by asking the user to name one, which is a question
 * they cannot answer well before they have seen the product — a workspace
 * groups repos, and they have not connected any repos yet. So the first one is
 * created for them under a generic name and the wizard starts at the step that
 * actually needs them: connecting GitHub. Renaming lives in Settings.
 *
 * This is the ONLY auto-create. An earlier version lived client-side in the
 * desktop's initial data load and was removed when the wizard shipped, because
 * a client-side create races the wizard's own step. Server-side it covers every
 * client — desktop, web, CLI, MCP — from one place, and none of them need to
 * know it happened.
 *
 * **It changes what "has this user onboarded?" can be inferred from.** The
 * desktop and web load paths used to read `workspaces.length > 0` as "returning
 * user, skip the wizard". That is now true of everyone, including someone who
 * signed up ten seconds ago, so those clients key off an actual GitHub
 * connection instead. If you add another caller here, check you are not
 * teaching some other code that a row's existence means the user is set up.
