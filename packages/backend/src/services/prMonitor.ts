/**
 * Derive the viewer's relationship to a PR from its fetched summary — the same
 * Mine / Review buckets the Search poll computes, but from a single PR's data
 * so a webhook refresh can set them without a Search call.
 *
 *   - authored: the viewer opened it.
 *   - reviewRequested: the viewer is a requested reviewer (directly, or via a
 *     team — `reviewRequestVia` is set by `annotateReviewRequest`), AND hasn't
 *     already reviewed it, AND isn't the author. GitHub drops an individual
 *     request once you review, but leaves a team request standing, so we also
 *     subtract "the viewer appears in recentReviews" (mirrors the Search
 *     `review-requested MINUS reviewed-by` logic; the reconcile sweep is the
 *     authoritative backstop for the recentReviews-window edge cases).
