// Merge queue v2 — the group evaluator.
//
// Evaluation is per-(repo, base) GROUP, triggered by events (fresh snapshot,
// check flush, task terminal, membership change) and by the reconciler. There
// is NO global tick and NO lock at all: distinct groups evaluate fully in
// parallel, a hung evaluation stalls only its own group (45s timeout), and
// concurrency safety — in-process AND cross-replica — is the CAS version on
// every entry write (see evaluateGroupOnce for why an advisory lock here was
// removed: it pinned a pool connection across GitHub calls and starved
// Supavisor under load).
//
// The walk itself carries v1's hard-won semantics verbatim: FIFO from the
// head, `hold` consumes the group's turn (one same-base merge in flight),
// `advance` skips past entries that can't make progress so a blocked head
// never gates the PRs behind it.
