/**
 * v2 entry lifecycle. Unlike the old 4-status jsonb blob, every state is
 * explicit and every state has a defined exit:
 *
 * - `queued`           — in line; not head, or head awaiting its next action.
 * - `awaiting_ci`      — head; the only obstacle is checks still running.
 * - `awaiting_review`  — head; the only obstacle is a missing required review.
 *                        No remediation applies (an agent can't approve a PR);
 *                        self-heals on the review webhook. The old processor
 *                        fired doomed fix runs at this state.
 * - `automerge_armed`  — head; clean-but-awaiting-CI with GitHub native
 *                        auto-merge enabled. GitHub merges the instant checks
 *                        pass; we observe it via the closed webhook.
 * - `awaiting_stack`   — the entry is a member of a stack and the PR its base
 *                        branch belongs to has NOT merged yet. Nothing can be
 *                        done to it: merging would land it in its parent's
 *                        branch instead of the real base. Self-heals the moment
 *                        the parent lands, which retargets this PR onto the
 *                        parent's base and returns it to `queued`.
 * - `awaiting_external`— the base branch is behind an external merge gate
 *                        (trunk.io / GitHub's native queue) and the PR has been
 *                        SUBMITTED to it. That system owns the merge now; we
 *                        track its state off the PR's labels and take the PR
 *                        back if it gets ejected.
 * - `fixing`           — a cloud fix run (blockers or re-sign) is in flight.
 * - `merging`          — a direct REST merge call is in flight. Persisted
 *                        BEFORE the call so a crash mid-merge is recoverable
 *                        (verify-merged — the June 2026 incident).
 * - `blocked`          — can't proceed, but SELF-HEALING: re-evaluated on
 *                        every relevant event, and a new head resets budgets.
 * - `blocked_manual`   — truly manual (GitHub refuses the App's merge with no
 *                        failing check to blame). Only dequeue/requeue clears.
 * - `merged`/`removed` — terminal; kept as history for the timeline.
