// Merge queue v2 — the action executor.
//
// Runs the decide → execute rounds for ONE entry. `decide` (pure) names the
// actions; this module performs them: CAS transitions with audit events,
// GitHub calls (merge / verify / re-run / signature probe), cloud fix-run
// dispatch, WS mirroring. Outcome-producing actions feed their result back
// into the context and re-invoke `decide`, bounded by MAX_DECIDE_ROUNDS.
//
// Concurrency contract: every persisted change is a CAS on entry.version. A
// lost CAS means another evaluation (other replica, newer trigger) got there
// first — this one drops its remaining actions and walks away. Nothing here
// may write state unconditionally except record_merged (GitHub having merged
// is ground truth that must never be lost to a version race).
