// Merge queue v2 — the pure decision function.

// Protocol: the executor performs the returned actions in order. Actions that
// produce data (verify_merged, probe_signatures, verify_live_then_merge,
// rerequest_failed_checks, update_branch) get their result folded into the
// context, and decide runs again — bounded by MAX_DECIDE_ROUNDS. The final

 * green, conflict-free PR reads exactly like a broken one. (Verified the day
 * trunk.io went live on posthog/posthog: all 20 most-recently-updated open PRs
 * came back MERGEABLE + BLOCKED, approved ones included.) Counting that as a

 * is ready and belongs in the external queue. BEHIND doesn't block either, for
 * the same reason one step further on: an external merge queue exists precisely
 * to REMOVE the up-to-date requirement — trunk.io tests each PR against the
 * current base itself and merges from its own branch, so "behind master" is the
 * steady state of every open PR on a busy repo, not work to be done. Acting on
 * it was the 2026-08-18 runaway: master advances (constantly, on
 * posthog/posthog), every submitted PR reads BEHIND, each one falls out of the
 * `awaiting_external` short-circuit into remediation, updates its branch, and
 * the resulting new head resets its budgets via R2 — so the fix-run cap can
 * never be reached and each base advance buys another paid cloud run.
 *
 * Everything `prBlocksMerge` covers still counts under a gate — conflicts,
 * requested changes and failing REQUIRED checks are real work no matter who
 * performs the merge, and the provider will hold the PR at "not ready" forever
 * until they're fixed. Pending CI and a missing required review are handled
 * upstream (R7/R7b) and never reach here.
 *
 * Unresolved threads deliberately do NOT count, of EITHER authorship — that is
 * the whole reason the queue asks `prBlocksMerge` rather than the watcher's
 * `prNeedsFollowup`. Queueing a PR is a request to merge it, not a request to
 * have an agent answer the comments on it first. The manual "Get PR mergeable"

  // R4b — MERGE STACK gate. The PR this one is based on hasn't landed yet, so

  // protection here: parent and child live in different (repo, base) groups
  // and are walked by two independent, possibly concurrent evaluations, and
  // decideCleanPath never reads ctx.isHead. So the gate must be an
  // unconditional rule that consults nothing about mode, head-ness, or gates.
  //
  // Why here and not elsewhere:
  //   after R0/R0b — a child merged or closed underneath us must terminate,
  //                  never park.
  //   after R1     — never interrupt a merge/submit aftermath mid-flight.

  //   after R3     — CRITICAL. A persisted `merging` must hit verify_merged
  //                  first, or we strand a PR GitHub already merged.
  //   after R4     — a draft is more actionable to the author than "waiting".
  //   before R5..R11 — a parked child must never arm auto-merge, be submitted
  //                  to trunk (which refuses stacks outright), fire a fix run,

  // test cycle per rung (~40 minutes each on posthog/posthog) plus a retarget
  // and often a paid rebase run between each pair, for work the provider does
  // once. So a batchable stack hands ONE rung to the provider and holds the
  // rest, rather than draining them.
