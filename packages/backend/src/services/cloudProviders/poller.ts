 * used to get exactly ONE attempt: the tick that observed the terminal status.
 * That tick happens the moment the run ends, which is the moment the provider's
 * durable log is least likely to exist yet (PostHog flushes session logs to S3
 * asynchronously). Miss it and the task is finalised, never selected again, and
 * its transcript stays null forever — which is why most completed PostHog tasks
 * had no transcript at all while the two someone happened to be watching live
 * did.
 *
 * 30 minutes of retries at the poll interval is far more than an async flush
 * needs, and the set is naturally tiny (only finished tasks whose transcript is
 * not yet the provider's record). Past the window, opening the task remains the
 * recovery path: its `refresh-logs` call runs the same backfill on demand.
 *
 * Measured from `updatedAt`, not `completedAt`, because the window covers EVERY
 * terminal status and `completedAt` is null for all but one of them — a failed
 * run, which is the one whose log somebody most wants to read, would have been
 * excluded by its own timestamp. For a `completed` task the two are the same
 * instant anyway. It relies on a finished task's row going quiet: a write per
 * tick would renew the window forever, which is why `patchTaskMetadata` no
 * longer writes when a patch changes nothing.
