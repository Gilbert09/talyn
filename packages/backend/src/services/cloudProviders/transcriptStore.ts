/**
 * The transcript machinery every cloud provider needs, in one place.
 *
 * # What is actually shared, and what is not
 *
 * docs/CLOUD_PROVIDERS.md defers a `TranscriptSource`/`TranscriptConverter`
 * abstraction "until a third provider exists", and spec §10.5 proposes a single
 * generic streamer owning seq assignment, the debounced persist, truncation,
 * live emission, reconnect-to-tail and watch-gating.
 *
 * Reading all three implementations, that list is too long. **Seq assignment is
 * not shared** — the three providers have genuinely different models:
 *
 *   - PostHog assigns its own monotonic seq as events arrive, continuing past a
 *     seeded transcript so a resumed run does not restart numbering.
 *   - Claude rebuilds the whole transcript every tick from the full event log,
 *     so seq is the array index and is only stable because the log is.
 *   - The fleet assigns seq HOST-side and it is authoritative, so a backend
 *     restart mid-run resumes with the numbering intact.
 *
 * Those are three different correctness arguments, not one mechanism with
 * three call sites. Nor is reconnect-to-tail shared (only PostHog has a live
 * SSE with Last-Event-ID resumption) or watch-gating (PostHog and the fleet
 * gate differently, Claude gates its event fetch rather than a stream).
 *
 * What IS shared, byte-for-byte across all three today, is everything below:
 * emit anything past the websocket cursor, debounce the durable write, truncate
 * the middle when it gets long, and rewrite the blob. That is what this owns.
 *
 * # Why the debounce matters
 *
 * Each persist REWRITES the whole jsonb array — a full re-TOAST, a WAL record
 * and a dead tuple every time — and it is the dominant consumer of the Supabase
 * disk-IO budget on an active run. Events still reach the UI live through
 * `emitTaskEvent` regardless, so a longer window costs nothing perceptible.

 *
 * Postgres `jsonb` cannot represent `\u0000`. Not "does not index it well" —
 * cannot store it: the write is rejected outright with `unsupported Unicode
 * escape sequence`. JSON the spec allows, a jsonb column does not.
 *
 * An agent transcript reaches one the moment a tool reads a binary file. Any
 * `cat` of a compiled artifact, any grep that wanders into a `.pyc`, any dump of
 * a core file, and the tool result carries NUL bytes into the event stream.
 *
 * What made this expensive is how it failed. The write is the LAST step: the
 * fleet had the full transcript, the poller fetched it correctly, and only the
 * persist was refused — so the task ran perfectly and displayed no logs at all,
 * with the failure visible only as a `[cloudPoller] reconcile failed` line whose
 * error text was buried under a megabyte of query params. And because the
 * transcript only grows, once a run touched one binary file EVERY later write
 * failed too. One `\u0000` costs the whole run's logs, not one event's.
 *
 * Walks the structure rather than regexing the serialised JSON, because in
 * serialised form the escape for a real NUL and the text `\u0000` a transcript
 * might legitimately quote differ only by a backslash — and getting that
 * distinction wrong corrupts the very tool output this exists to preserve.
