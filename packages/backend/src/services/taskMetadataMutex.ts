/**
 * Per-task serializer for `tasks.metadata` read-modify-write patches.
 *
 * Why this exists: `gitService.runGit` records each git command via a
 * fire-and-forget `void recordGitCommand(...)`. That writes
 * `metadata.gitLog` asynchronously, on its own write chain. Other
 * metadata writers (autoCommit status, finalFiles snapshot,
 * pullRequest result, scheduler rollback marker) used to do their own
 * `SELECT metadata → modify → UPDATE` outside that chain — so a slow
 * writer's UPDATE could land after a concurrent gitLog UPDATE,
 * silently clobbering the just-appended entries (and vice versa,
 * losing the autoCommit field).
 *
 * Forensic on the user's prod DB found tasks where the autoCommit
 * commit DID happen — SHA is real, on origin — but `metadata.autoCommit`
 * came out `undefined` AND the matching gitLog entries (`add -A`,
 * `commit -m`, etc.) were missing, while later cleanup entries
 * survived. Classic stale-write race.
 *
 * This serializer makes every patch share one chain per taskId. Each
 * patch runs SELECT → user fn → UPDATE → emit, head-of-line, in order.
 * Different taskIds run independently. The fire-and-forget gitLog
 * writer also routes through here — same chain, no torn writes
 * between gitLog and autoCommit/finalFiles/PR writers.
