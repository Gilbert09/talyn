/**
 * Serving an adopted run's credentials back to the host that lost them.
 *
 * # Why the host asks instead of being told
 *
 * A fleet host holds credentials only in memory (fleet spec §12.4), so a fleetd
 * restart loses them and the surviving microVM cannot authenticate anything.
 * The original repair was a push: the backend polls, notices `adopted`, and
 * POSTs them back. That puts the obligation on the party that has to NOTICE,
 * and on 2026-08-05 that chain broke three times in half an hour — a once-per-
 * task guard suppressed one run's second adoption, and a fleetd pegged at 209%
 * CPU made the polls that would have re-credentialed two others time out first.
 * All three ran blind for eighteen minutes and were reported as
 * "guest did not reconnect".
 *
 * The host knows, at a definite moment, that it has lost them. So it asks.
 *
 * # The authorization, which is the whole security story
 *
 * This hands out a workspace's GitHub token and Anthropic key to a caller
 * holding only `FLEET_REPORT_TOKEN` — a deployment-wide secret shared by every
 * host. Without a check, that token would be enough to name any run id and
 * collect the credentials behind it.
 *
 * So the answer is bounded to what the caller already legitimately had: a run
 * this backend itself dispatched, TO THIS HOST, that is still in flight. Then a
 * host can only ever re-obtain credentials it was already holding a moment ago,
 * which makes the pull no more powerful than the push it replaces.
 *
 * `host` is taken from the body rather than the source address on purpose:
 * reports arrive NAT'd (see `FleetHostReport.apiEndpoint`), so the source
 * address is not an identity and treating it as one would be a check that looks
 * like it works.
