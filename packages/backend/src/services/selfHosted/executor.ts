 * The publishing instruction is load-bearing, not boilerplate.

 * `posthog/posthog` requires verified signatures, so every `git push` came back
 * `GH013: Commits must have verified signatures`. There is no signing key in the
 * VM and there must not be one. The agent then spent minutes probing GitHub API
 * routes looking for a way through — all correctly refused by the credential
 * proxy — and in the process created an empty review draft it could not delete.
 *
 * `fleet-publish` is the way through: it asks the credential proxy to create the
 * commit through GitHub's API, which signs it server-side. Telling the agent
 * that git push WILL fail matters as much as telling it the alternative exists,
 * because an agent that believes push should work treats the refusal as
 * something to route around.
