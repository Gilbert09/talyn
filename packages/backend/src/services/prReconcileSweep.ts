/**
 * Low-frequency safety net for the webhook pipeline.
 *
 * Webhooks are best-effort: GitHub can drop a delivery, a replica can crash
 * mid-process, and a paused/suspended installation receives nothing while it's
 * off. This sweep re-polls every connected workspace on a long, jittered
 * interval — re-deriving buckets + summaries exactly as a scheduled tick would
 * — so anything a webhook missed self-heals within one sweep. It reuses
 * prMonitor.refreshWorkspaceNow; it does NOT add GitHub load beyond the normal
 * poll (it IS a poll, just slower).
 *
 * The same per-workspace refresh is exposed for on-demand use (install
 * (re)connect, paused→active) via prMonitorService.refreshWorkspaceNow directly.
