/**
 * The durable half of a run.
 *
 * A fleet host retires a terminal run's record two hours after it ends — the
 * ledger it reads at startup would otherwise become a scan of every run the box
 * has ever done (see the retention sweep in fleet's supervisor). After that the
 * host answers "no such run", which is how the console came to show that for
 * every run older than an afternoon, transcript included.
 *
 * The transcript is not lost: the provider's streamer persists it to
 * `tasks.transcript` as it arrives, and the task row outlives the host's copy by
 * design — "terminal ones are the backend's own record" is the reason the fleet
 * only reports ACTIVE runs upward. The console just never asked.
 *
 * The join key is the deterministic run id the executor assigns: `talyn-<taskId>`.
