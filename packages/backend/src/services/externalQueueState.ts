// Where an external merge queue (trunk.io) says a PR currently is.
//
// The signal is the provider's own PR comment, which trunk EDITS IN PLACE
// through the lifecycle (instruction → "Submitted to Merge" → "Running tests"
// → "Merged successfully" / a failure). Two things follow:
//
//  1. **Every edit is a webhook.** `issue_comment/edited` is already a refresh
//     event, so the worker hands the fresh body here and the cache is warm
//     before the merge-queue evaluation it triggers even runs. That makes the
//     common path free — no extra GitHub call for a state we were told about.
//  2. **A cold cache still needs an answer** (a restart, a missed delivery, a
//     PR submitted before this shipped), so there's a REST fallback, gated on a
//     caller-chosen max age. The caller picks that age by how much the answer
//     can change: see `externalStateMaxAge` in mergeQueue/executor.ts.
//
// Deliberately NOT read off labels here — `externalQueueStatusFromLabels` still
// does that, as the fallback channel, in `decide`. Trunk's labels are optional
// in its config and were entirely absent on the PRs this module was written
// for (see externalMergeQueue.ts).

 * cycle away. It is wrong for the instant before a push, because the one event
 * the staleness hides is the one that matters — the provider accepting the PR.
 * PostHog/posthog#100150 lost two test cycles to exactly that: trunk queued it
 * at 15:41:40 and Talyn's branch update landed at 15:42:07, 27 seconds inside a
 * window the caller was allowed to read as "nobody has this PR".
 *
 * So this always re-reads (max age 0). It costs one REST call, it is only ever
 * called on a gated base, and it is only called when the caller is about to
 * spend a push — which is far more expensive than the call, and, in a batching
 * queue, expensive for every OTHER PR being tested on top of this one too.
 *
 * Answers null when nothing holds the PR, when the provider says nothing, and
 * when GitHub cannot be read: the caller's own evidence then decides, exactly
