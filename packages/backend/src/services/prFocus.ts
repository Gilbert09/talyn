/**
 * Per-PR focus + post-refresh cooldown registry.
 *
 * Adaptive-polling lives here. Two signals the prMonitor reads each
 * tick to decide whether a PR is stale enough to re-fetch:
 *
 *   1. Focus: a desktop client posted /pull-requests/:id/focus, so
 *      that PR (and its repo) gets the tighter TTL (30 s vs 60 s).
 *      Modeled on supacode's `focusedWorktreeId` concept — the user
 *      cares more about the PR they're looking at right now.
 *
 *   2. Cooldown: a manual /refresh just fetched fresh state. Skip
 *      the next 5 s of poll-driven refetches so user-initiated
 *      action doesn't get stomped by a racing scheduled refresh.
 *
 * Pure in-memory; intentionally not persisted. The desktop re-
 * announces focus on reconnect (subscribes are already cleared on
 * WS reconnect anyway), and cooldown is short enough that loss on
 * backend restart is irrelevant.
