/**
 * "The run is gone" must be terminal, not retryable.
 *
 * On 2026-08-06 a fleet host restarted while five tasks were mid-run. Two of them
 * then reconciled every tick for 21 hours, each attempt failing with `no such
 * run` — the host was healthy and idle the whole time, and nothing ever concluded
 * that a vanished run is never coming back. The log filled with one identical
 * failure per tick per task.
 *
 * The distinction being pinned here: unreachable / no-capacity / rate-limited all
 * mean "ask again later", because the run may well still be executing on the
 * metal. A reachable host saying it has no such run is authoritative.
