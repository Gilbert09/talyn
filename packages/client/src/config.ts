/**
 * The host-application seam.
 *
 * This package is the ONE definition of the backend contract — every route
 * signature, every WS event, the 401-retry choreography, the reconnect
 * backoff — shared by the desktop renderer and the browser app so a backend
 * change can't be applied to one client and forgotten in the other.
 *
 * To stay shared it can't know how any particular host stores a session or
 * where its build-time env came from. The desktop reads `process.env.TALYN_*`
 * baked in by webpack and holds its session in Electron `safeStorage`; the
 * web app reads Vite `define` values and uses `localStorage`. Both inject
 * that here instead of this package importing either.
